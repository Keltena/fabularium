=================================================
AGILITY: THE (MOSTLY) UNIVERSAL AGT INTERPRETER
Version 1.1.1
=================================================

  This is an interpreter for game files created with Malmberg and
Welch's _Adventure Game Toolkit_. AGiliTy is universal in the sense
that it understands and interprets most of the many versions of the
AGT game file format (unlike the original interpreters which were
only intended to run the game file format associated with them) and
also in that it is written in ANSI C and so should be straightforward
to port to other systems.

  It is *not* a port of the original interpreters but rather a
completely new interpreter built around the game file format; while it
follows the original interpreters on most things, there are some
differences which are described below.

------------------------
 AGT AND AGX GAME FILES
------------------------
  Games in the AGT format can be found at the Interactive Fiction archive:
    ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/agt

  AGT games are recognizable by having several different files with
names like 'MYGAME.D$$', 'MYGAME.DA1', 'MYGAME.DA2', ... ,
'MYGAME.DA6', 'MYGAME.TTL', etc. They also usually come with a DOS
runtime interpreter (usually called RUN.EXE or MRUN.EXE), which can be
deleted without affecting AGiliTy. (DOS users might want to keep it
around 'just in case', depending on how much hard drive space is
available)

   AGiliTy also has its own file format (with extension "AGX", which
stands for "Adventure Game eXecutable"); existing AGT games can be
converted into this format using the utility agt2agx which comes with
AGiliTy. They can also be created from AGT source code by using the
Magx compiler, available in
    ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/agt/magx/

  The new format takes all of the various AGT files (MYGAME.DA1,
MYGAME.DA2, MYGAME.DA3, MYGAME.DA4, MYGAME.DA5, MYGAME.DA6, MYGAME.TTL,
MYGAME.INS, MYGAME.VOC, MYGAME.D$$, MYGAME.OPT, and parts of
MYGAME.CFG) and puts all of the data in one file (MYGAME.AGX).
  Aside from the reduction in directory clutter, it has the
following advantages:
 1)It's smaller; for large games the new format can save over 100K
    (The most extreme case I've run across so far is Shades of Gray:
     790K vs. 568K uncompressed or 273K vs. 148K ZIPed)
 2)It loads more quickly since it's closer in structure to AGiliTy's
    internal format. (In particular, the interpreter doesn't need to
    build the dictionary or convert metacommand opcodes into a common
    format).
 3)It's more portable. For example, there are platforms out there that
    can't handle the 'D$$' extension.


------------------------
 AGT VERSIONS SUPPORTED
------------------------
  AGiliTy understands the following versions of AGT (which includes
every AGT game at ftp.ifarchive.org that I know of):
  --1.0
  --1.18
  --the early "Classic AGT": e.g. 1.19, 1.2, 1.21
  --"Classic AGT", both big and small: e.g. 1.3, 1.32, 1.35, 1.5, 1.7
  --the "Even Bigger 1.32" used by _Cosmoserve_
  --the "Chemically Altered 1.32" used by _Shades of Gray_,
  --Menichelli's 1.82[untested] and 1.83
  --Both known "proto-Master's Edition" 1.5 variants
  --The proto-Master's Edition 1.6 variant used by Pork.
  --Both Master's Edition 1.0 variants.
  --The Master's Edition 1.5/1.51, 1.55, and 1.56/1.6/1.7.

   _The Pyramids of Mars_ and _Cliff Diver_ require configuration
options to be set; they use variant interpreters that are supported
but can't be detected by the interpreter.
  In particular, _Pyramids_ needs the ALT_ANY option and
_Cliff Diver_ requires the IRUN option.

   _Klaustrophobia_ is now supported. Use AGiliTy to play each of the
chapters as usual. To switch between chapters, just SAVE at the end
of one chapter and RESTORE at the beginning of the next (the
game will tell you when to switch chapters; however, use SAVE instead
of DONE1 or DONE2). This is still experimental and so I'd appreciate
any feedback on how well it works (or doesn't work, as the case may
be).
  Unlike the MS-DOS programs that _Klaustrophobia_ originally used for
this, AGiliTy doesn't check that you've actually reached the end of the
previous chapter; be warned that if you switch chapters before the game
tells you to, things may break.
  There is also no way for AGiliTy to support the intermission or
endgame text from the original game: these are all printed out
by DOS programs rather than by the AGT interpreter.


-----------------------------------------------------------
 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AGILITY AND THE ORIGINAL INTERPRETERS
-----------------------------------------------------------
 --Disambiguation is done on the normal command entry line rather than
having a special prompt.
 --When asked "Which object do you mean?", it is possible to reply
ANY, EITHER, BOTH, or ALL, as well as giving the name of an object.
 --LISTEXIT ON, LISTEXIT OFF will turn automatic listing of exits on or
off (in AGT there is a LIST EXITS command, so some AGT games don't list
exits to rooms).
 --OOPS, UNDO, and RESTART are supported (at least on systems with
enough memory).
 --Adjective-only matches are accepted by the parser.
 --The parser is capable of intelligent disambiguation.
 --It is is also able to expand ALL and ALL EXCEPT (when appropriate
options are set).
 --Some more multiple word verbs are automatically recognized (for
example, GET IN is automatically translated into ENTER).
 --Some built-in verbs have additional synonyms. (In particular,
standard one-letter abbreviations are supported: X for EXAMINE, Z for
WAIT)
 --Game-specific synonyms are given a higher priority by the parser than
the generic built-in synonyms.
 --The standard error messages are different than the original (except
in Master's Edition games where most of the standard error messages
are included in the game file)
 --SCRIPT output is sent to a file rather than to the printer.
 --AGiliTy has an extended AGILDEBUG debugging verb and supports more
detailed metacommand tracing output.
 --AGiliTy uses a different save file format.
 --COLORS is not supported, although on some systems equivalent
functionality is supported in the configuration file.
 --The special title screen effects of the Shades of Gray and Cosmoserve97
interpreters aren't duplicated.
 --Graphics, sound, and fonts are not supported on all platforms.


-----------------------
 LIST OF SPECIAL VERBS
-----------------------
These are all of the special verbs recognized by the interpreter:
SCORE	Print out your score.
NOTIFY	Turn score notification on and off
INSTRUCTIONS or INS  Display the instructions for the game.
INTRODUCTION or INTRO	Repeat the introduction of the game.
VIEW <picture>  Views an illustration. (Not supported on all platforms.)
BRIEF   Don't print room descriptions for rooms you've seen.
VERBOSE Print room descriptions even  for rooms you've already seen.
LIST EXITS List the exits from a room.
LISTEXIT ON,OFF	 Turn on/off automatic listing of exits.
SCRIPT	Start sending a transcript to a file.
UNSCRIPT  Stop creating a transcript.
SOUND ON, OFF  Turn sound on/off.
LOG	Start sending all of your commands to a file.
REPLAY <number>  Replay your commands from a file, one every <number>
	seconds.
REPLAY FAST  Replay your commands from a file without waiting for you
             to read the scrolling text.
REPLAY STEP  Replay your commands from a file, one for every keypress.
AGILDEBUG  Access debugging commands.
MENU	Toggle menu mode on or off.
OOPS	Correct a word you just mistyped; must be the first command on
	a line.
UNDO	Undo your last move; must be the first command on a line.
SAVE	Save the game.
RESTORE	Restore the game.
RESTART	Restart the game.
QUIT	Quit


---------------------
 CONFIGURATION FILES
---------------------
  The interpreter gets configuration information from as many as three
places: the global configuration file (containing things that you want
to apply to every game you play), the game-specific configuration
file (usually with an extension '.cfg'), and, in the case of AGX-format
games, the game file itself.
  Options in the game-specific file override options specified from
the other two sources; options in the AGX file override those in the
global file.

  The following configuration options are supported on all platforms.
Other options may be supported on your particular system; see
appropriate platform-specific documentation for information.
   Each option should be on a separate line in the configuration file.
Lines starting with '#' will be treated as comments and ignored.
Options can be negated by prefixing them with 'NO_' so that, for
example, DEBUG would become NO_DEBUG.

General options:
  VERBOSE  Start the game in VERBOSE mode
  DEBUG	Allow the use of AGILDEBUG for pre-Master's games (For
	Master's Edition games, this decision is based on the DEBUG
	flag in the game file itself)
  DEFAULT_ERRORS  Cause AGiliTy to use its own internal defaults
        for standard error messages even if the game file defines its own.
	(Recommended for most Master's Edition games.)
  PATH  Gives a space-separated search path for AGT games. [Not supported
	on all platforms.]
  TONE  Enables the *tone* action token, which allows games to make
        annoying beeps on some platforms.  The only game I might recommend
	enabling this for is  _CosmoServe_ which has some interesting
	sound effects.  Not all platforms support this command.
  INPUT_BOLD  Makes the input line bold. (This doesn't work on all platforms)
  IBM_CHAR  Try to use the IBM character set; don't translate them.
	If your platform doesn't support the IBM character set, this is
	likely to produce garbage.
  NO_ERROR  Supress GAME ERROR messages during play. Some poorly written
        AGT games contain bad metacommands, out-of-range tokens, or other
	problems; this option will supress the messages reporting these
	sorts of problems.
  SMART_DISAMBIG   This turns on smart disambiguation. This works better
	with some games than others.
  EXPAND_ALL  This turns on ALL and ALL EXCEPT expansion in the parser (by
	default, expanding them is the responsibility of the individual
	verb execution routines); see remarks on SMART_DISAMBIG: both of these
	options use the same engine and so they are likely to work or fail
	together. If you're using this, you'll probably also want to set
	FIX_MULTINOUN.
  IGNORE_SIZE Ignore weight and size limits on how much the player can
        carry. (There remain limits on the size and weight of any
        individual object.)

Game specific options
  (Many of these are more useful to game authors than game players.)
  PROPER_CREATURE  Treat all creature names as proper nouns.
     (In particular, this will cause them to be capitalized and to
     not have "the" appear in front of them.)  Use of DEFAULT_ERRORS
     is recommended with this option.
  ROOMTITLE  Print the room title in bold before the room  description
	in pre-Master's games. (Master's Edition games do this
	automatically)
  IRUN  Print error messages in first person. This should be set for
	_Cliff Diver_.
  NO_BLOCK_HOSTILE  Allow the player to leave a room containing a hostile
	creature if they go back the way they came.
  NO_GET_HOSTILE  Prevents the player from picking up objects in a room
	containing a hostile creature. (Intended to be used with
	NO_BLOCK_HOSTILE)
  NO_OBJECT_NOTES  Turns off notes after object description,
	such as '[providing light]'.
  CONST_TIME  Increment time at a constant rate instead of randomly.
  SLASH_BOLD  If set the slash character toggles bold on and off.
	(This should be set automatically for 1.8x games, but you may still
	 need to set it explicitly for version 1.82 )
  PRONOUN_SUBS  Do $you$-style substitutions even in  game-author
	defined messages.
  ALT_ANY This scans the ANY metacommands *with* the <verb>
	metacommands rather than before them.  Should be set for
	_Pyramids of Mars_ and not for any other games I know of.
  CHECK_GRAMMAR  Print out error messages if the player enters a verb
	with too many objects. (For example, "N KEY").
  FORCE_LOAD  Force AGX game to load even if interpreter isn't of the
        right version.  Don't use this unless you know what you're
        doing: Magx doesn't assign minimum version numbers without
        reason.
  PURE_AFTER  Causes LOOK and other end-of-turn actions to take place
      after AFTER commands. (This is on by default for Master's
      Edition games.)
  FIXED_FONT
      Force system to use a fixed-pitch font.
  NO_FIXED_FONT
      Allow the system to use proportional fonts.

Technical options: These are fine tuning.
  FIX_METAVERB  Don't run ANY metacommands when executing a metaverb.
  FIX_MULTINOUN	  Only advance one turn when manipulating multiple nouns,
	rather than a turn for each noun.
  PURE_ANSWER   Require AND-connected answers to be in the right order.
	(The Master's Edition documentation claims order doesn't
	matter, but with the actual interpreters it does)

Parse Options: These are all pretty technical.
  PURE_DUMMY   Allow dummy verbs to be run by typing "dummy_verb3"
  PURE_SUBNAME Allow subroutines to be run by typing "subroutine3"
  PURE_SYNONYM Treat synonyms exactly as nouns.
  ADJ_NOUN     Don't pick noun matches over adjective-only matches.

-------------------
 DEBUGGING OPTIONS
-------------------
  With AGILDEBUG you can access various debugging commands.  You can
move objects around; change the values of flags, variables and
counters; list objects in the game; examine and edit objects; and turn
metacommand tracing on or off.

  (Note: You can change almost all of the fields associated with
an object using the View/Edit Object option; be warned that many of
them are not SAVEd or RESTOREd since they can't be changed during
normal play. If you change one of these and then RESTORE or UNDO, it
will stay changed. Conversely, if you make a change, save, quit, and
restore, the changed value will not be preserved. The fields having
this behavior are marked.)

  When metacommand tracing is on, every metacommand that is run will
be displayed. You can turn off tracing of ANY metacommands and tracing
of metacommands during disambiguation (the latter is off by default).

  In addition, AGiliTy has a test mode which automatically reads a
log file from <gamename>.LOG (or equivalent) and writes a script to
<gamename>.SCR. In this mode, the random number generator is forced to
be non-random, allowing for automated testing of games.
  To use this, you create a LOG file (either by hand, by using the
'-c' option, or by using LOG-- note that this log file needs to
include everything from the very beginning, including the key hit at
the end of the title screen, so if using the LOG command you'll need
to add a line or two at the beginning.)
  Run AGiliTy in test mode once to get the script. Copy the script
to some other file.  Then, whenever you make a change to your game
file, rerun AGiliTy and compare the new script with the old one.
(There are programs that will do this automatically and just print
out the lines that have changed.)


---------------
 AGT GAME LIST
---------------
  Here is a list of a few of the better or more popular AGT games,
along with their filename in ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/agt/;
it is in no way exhaustive.
   I've also included references to reviews in issues of SPAG and
XYZZYnews; these can be found in if-archive/magazines/SPAG and
if-archive/magazines/XYZZYnews respectively.


Shades of Gray (soggy97.zip) by Mark Baker, Steve Bauman, Belisana
    Magnificent, Mike Laskey, Judith Pintar, "Hercules", and Cindy Yans
  Widely considered to be the best AGT game ever written. This is a
  'real life' game that is concerned more with the protagonist's
  ideals and mental state than with "adventuring".  You open the game
  with amnesia and need to figure out who you are and recover your
  memory. To say more would give too much away. It's a bit uneven (it
  was written by a team of seven people) and it opens with an
  arbitrary puzzle that's a potental show-stopper, but overall this is
  an excellent game.
    SPAG 2, 8; XYZZY 11(interview with one of the authors)


Cosmoserve (cosmos97.zip)  Judith Pintar
  Another strong AGT game. In it, you take the role of R.J. Wright,
  free-lance programmer/plumber, who is trying to finish a program
  that is due the next morning. You will need to log on to Cosmoserve
  and interact with the other users in order to be able to do this.
  It has a clever interface that really captures both the DOS
  command-line and life online pre-GUI. This is, however, a game
  you'll have to play through several times to win since it requires
  tight timing to be in all of the right places at the right times.
    SPAG 5; XYZZY 1, 11(interview with the author)


The Jeweled Arena (tja.zip)  David S. Raley
  This game is divided into four chapters; in each chapter you are
  a different person (although the first and third chapters share the
  same main character). Games like this often suffer from a lack of
  unity; this game, however, holds together quite well.  In part, this
  is because all of the chapters take place in a single, large,
  setting: the city of Kumeran. You can visit locations multiple times, as
  different characters. Locations that are unimportant in one chapter
  may be of great importance in a later chapter. In general, the world
  has a lot of depth, from diaries of the main characters to newspaper
  articles to books on law. On the other hand, it could have used some
  more beta-testing. There are several guess-the-verb puzzles and a quite
  a few bugs; most of the bugs are just amusing, but at least one (in
  chapter 3) can cause the game to become silently unwinnable for no
  obvious reason if you do a certain action in the wrong place.


Pastoral Pitfalls (pp20.zip) Guy Marquardt
  In this game you are the pastor of a Lutheran church; you need to
  make it through the day fufilling all of your responsibilities
  (which include visiting the sick, teaching a confirmation class,
  preparing a sermon, and still finding time to pray) I haven't
  finished this game, but the parts I've seen I've liked.  The game
  seems to have been well tested; it's mostly free of guess-the-verb
  problems and bugs.   It feels very open; you have a lot of freedom
  in what order to do things (although some care is needed so you don't
  run out of time).
    XYZZY 9(preview)


The Multi-Dimensional Thief (mdthief1.zip)  Joel Finch
    [Summary/review by Audrey De Lisle]
  You are a thief desiring to become a member of the Thieves' Guild.
  The test for this is to find the way out of the house.  This seems
  rather easy, but it's not.  One feature is a visit to OZ; another
  feat is done while quite small.  The amazing machine is fun to use
  and you must learn how to use it to get in an otherwise closed room.
  You can order things from a catalog and part of the game is to
  figure out which items you need.  I would recommend this game to
  those who like a little humor with their puzzles.
  [There is also a non-AGT version of this game.]

AGiliTy, notes for the Glk version
----------------------------------

(General information can be found in readme.agility)


Introduction
------------

This is a port of the AGiliTy interpreter to Glk.  The complete interface
lives in the single file

	os_glk.c

The main test and development system for the port is Linux, with Xglk as the
Glk library.

Glk AGiliTy is configured to be as close as possible to the pure ANSI build.
This is because Glk is a cross-platform I/O library, so using pure ANSI gives
it the best chance of working on multiple Glk libraries.


Acknowledgments
---------------

Thanks to Robert Masenten, rcm-math@pacbell.net, for answering several queries
about porting AGiliTy to Glk, and for writing AGiliTy in the first place; Ben
Hines, bhines@alumni.ucsd.edu, for the Mac-specific portions of the Glk
porting code; and Andrew Plotkin, <erkyrath@eblong.com>, for Glk, and for
putting me straight on a couple of the finer points of Glk operation.


Running Games
-------------

The interpreter understands both standard AGT game files and "AGX format"
(AGiliTy file format) game files.  Standard AGT games are distributed as a
collection of files, with different extensions (".d$$", ".da1", ".da2" and so
on).  AGiliTy games use the extension ".agx".

Give the name of the game to run at the system prompt.  For example, if the
game is held in files "cosmos.d$$", "cosmos.da1", and so on, use

	glkagil cosmos

If several builds of Glk AGiliTy are available, linked with a selection of Glk
libraries, they will be named appropriately, for example xagil, termagil, and
cheapagil.

The interpreter prefers that filename extensions be lower-case, that is,
".da1", ".da2", ".agx", and so on, rather than ".DA1", ".DA2", and ".AGX".  If
you are unpacking AGT files from ZIP archives, you may need to use unzip's '-L'
option to make sure that filename are extracted correctly.

Having said that, there's a minor GLK-specific patch in the core AGiliTy
interpreter (filename.c, for what it's worth) that retries a file with an
uppercase extension if the expected lowercase name is not found.  That should
help with archives unpacked without the '-L' option.  Running a game then
becomes

	glkagil COSMOS

Glk AGiliTy takes a small liberty with the C runtime on exit.  It might cause
some problems, such as a core dump or abort, when the program exits on an
error condition.  If you find that this happens on your system, you can either
rebuild to avoid this, as described below, or set a value for the environment
variable GLKAGIL_CLEAN_EXIT.

As well as standard AGiliTy command line options, there are a number of Glk
Agility specific command line options that you can specify, to vary the way
that the game looks:

	-gf	Force Glk to use only a fixed width font
	-gp	Allow Glk to use only a proportional font
	-ga	Try to use a suitable Glk font automatically
	-gd	Delay for the full period in Glk
	-gh	Delay for approximately half the period in Glk
	-gn	Turn off all game delays in Glk
	-gr	Turn off Glk text replacement
	-gx	Turn off Glk abbreviation expansions
	-gs	Display a short status window in Glk
	-gl	Display an extended status window in Glk
	-gc	Turn off Glk command escapes in games
	-gD	Turn on Glk port module debug tracing
	-g#	Test for clean exit (Glk module debugging only)

See below for further information about what these options mean.


Compiling
---------

To compile Glk AGiliTy for Linux, first unpack the source files.  You might
need to use the -a argument to unzip in order to convert text files for your
system.

Edit Makefile.glk so that it has the right path to the Glk library you wish to
build with.  If you want to build the IFP plugin, also edit the parts of
Makefile.glk that have paths to IFP components.

To build a standalone version of Glk AGiliTy, use

	make -f Makefile.glk glkagil

To build the IFP plugin, use

	make -f Makefile.glk agility-1.1.1.so

To clean up and delete everything in the case of a build error, use

	make -f Makefile.glk clean

Glk AGiliTy contains a few non-ANSI/ISO artifacts that might cause problems on
non-Linux systems:

	Fdopen(), dup(), and file descriptors, used to open save and restore
	files, are not portable.  You can turn off these features by defining
	GLK_ANSI_ONLY in Makefile.glk.

	At times the module may indirectly call exit() from within an
	atexit() handler.  This is "undefined" in ANSI.  The Linux and SVR4
	C runtime libraries behave well, but if you find it causes problems
	(for example, an occasional core dump or abort on exit) you can turn
	it off by defining GLK_CLEAN_EXIT in Makefile.glk.

See the comments in the source for Glk AGiliTy for more information on these,
and the information on "-g#" later on in this readme file for details on how
to check for problems with exit() and atexit().

For building on the Mac platform, Ben Hines has supplied a set of Code-Warrior
and application specific settings in a resource file, for use with the Mac Glk
library.  You should find this file in the source distribution under the name

	os_glk_MacResFile.hqx

The source of Glk AGiliTy has changed somewhat since Ben created this resource
file, so it may, or may not, currently be fully functional.


Configuration
-------------

Glk AGiliTy opens no global configuration file, and takes no special
configuration options.

If you need to set options that can't be set with AGiliTy command-line flags,
you'll need to create a special file called <game>.cfg alongside the other AGT
game files, or edit any existing <game>.cfg.  Glk AGiliTy will find this file.


Status Lines
------------

Glk AGiliTy displays a status window at the top of its display, providing the
Glk library it is using supports separate windows.  The status window can show
either one or two lines, for normal or extended status.

The first line of status is the standard information printed by the core
interpreter or the game, normally the location, and the game score and/or time.
The second line shows a list of exits available, and if in a game delay, a
waiting indicator.

You can use the "-gs" option to select a short status display, and "-gl" to
select an extended status display.

Where the Glk library does not support separate windows, Glk AGiliTy will
print the status line in "[...]" brackets at the beginning of any game output,
but only when it has changed since the last game turn.  It will also only
print the short status display; to get a list of exits, use the AGiliTy
"listexits" command.


Expanding Abbreviations
-----------------------

Many IF games systems allow a player to use single character abbreviations for
selected common commands, for example, 'x' for 'examine', 'l' for look, and so
on.

AGiliTy expands many of these in the same way, but it's not completely
consistent with other well-known systems.  To try to help with this, Glk
AGiliTy will automatically expand a selection of single character commands,
before passing the expanded string to the game as input.  It expands a command
only if the first word of the command is a single letter, and one of the
following:

	'c' -> "close"		'g' -> "again"		'i' -> "inventory"
	'k' -> "attack"		'l' -> "look"		'p' -> "open"
	'q' -> "quit"		'r' -> "drop"		't' -> "take"
	'x' -> "examine" 	'y' -> "yes"		'z' -> "wait"

If you want to suppress abbreviation expansion, you can prefix your input with
a single quote character (like putting literal strings into a spreadsheet).
If you do this, the Glk interface will strip the quote, then pass the rest of
the string to the main interpreter without any more changes.  So for example,

	'x something

will pass the string "x something" back to the game, whereas

	x something

will pass "examine something" back to the game.

You can turn off abbreviation expansions with the command line option '-gx'.


Game Text Output
----------------

AGT games generally presume they are running on fixed width font, 80x25 IBM PC
displays.  They expect to have this screen width on many occasions, and use
spaces, IBM box-drawing and other code page 437 characters, and other DOS
'tricks' to achieve certain effects with output text, creating line breaks as
needed.

In comparison, Glk's basic text model is that the output library should take
care of text formatting.  It behaves best when using a proportional font, and
sticks rigidly to ISO-8859 Latin 1 character encoding which, while it has
international characters in it, does not have box drawing characters.

This leads to somewhat of a mismatch of requirements and capabilities for the
Glk version of AGiliTy.  While Glk will work with fixed width fonts, it does
not necessarily offer any form of attributes or color for such fonts, making
the output appear one-dimensional and lifeless.  On the other hand, the
assumption in games and the interpreter is that the font is fixed width, and
the screen is 80 columns wide.

To attempt to smooth over this, Glk AGiliTy will try to guess whether a chunk
of game output text needs to be displayed in a fixed width font, or if it will
look okay when rendered in a proportional one.  This is akin to a form of
"screen scrape": Glk AGiliTy buffers all of the text that the game outputs,
then runs over it with a set of functions that try to re-paragraph the text,
identify any tables or other areas that are likely to be sensitive to font
width, and finally print it out through Glk in what is hopefully an improved
format.

Doing this involves some guesswork on the part of Glk AGiliTy, but in testing,
it seems to work well enough.

You can use the "-ga" option to let Glk AGiliTy automatically select what
appears to be a suitable font for output, "-gf" to force it to always use a
fixed width font, or "-gp" to force it to always use a proportional font (if
the Glk library has one).  You can also control it while in a game using the
"glk fonts" command.

Note that some games _do_ hint at the type of font they can be used with,
though most don't.  A game may tell the interpreter

	1) that a fixed width font is required, or
	2) that a proportional font is acceptable, or
	3) nothing

In the third case, the interpreter does not know whether a proportional font
can be used, or not.  The majority of AGT games seem to fall into the third
case, and the interpreter rarely knows the font requirements of a game.

Any game which does tell the interpreter what font it can use will cause Glk
AGiliTy to use that font style on startup, and ignore any value set with the
"-g" command line option.  You may still however alter the font control with
"glk fonts" while in a game.

In Glk libraries that have only fixed width fonts (for example, Glkterm, for
ncurses), you will see much less difference in the display with the different
values for font control, but it may still be useful if the text mode display
differs widely from AGT's anticipated 80x25 dimension.

Since many games rely on there being 80 columns of display width, Glk AGiliTy
also offers a command to query the current display width.  The command to use
is

	glk width

entered at the game's ">" prompt.  This prints the approximate width of the
display window (actually, it prints the width of the status window, but
assuming the fonts in use in each window are approximately the same, the result
will usually be close enough).  Some Glk libraries are not able to return a
window width.

In general, where a game has a strong requirement for fixed width font text,
80 columns or more of display width will probably be fine.


Message Replacements
--------------------

Because Glk AGiliTy buffers all game output, and scans the buffer for ways to
try to improve text formatting, it can also replace some of the standard
AGiliTy interpreter messages with ones that stand out a little better in a Glk
display.

For example, games usually start up with a message something like:

                   This game is being executed by
 AGiliTy: The (Mostly) Universal AGT Interpreter  version 1.1.1
           Copyright (C) 1996-99,2001 by Robert Masenten
                           Glk version

Glk AGiliTy will replace this with more or less the same text, but using
heading and emphasized text.  It handles only a few messages in this way,
typically LISTEXIT, VERBOSE, and BRIEF responses, game title pages, and the
AGiliTy information page header.

To turn this feature off, use the '-gr' command line option.


Game Delays
-----------

In AGT games that use delays, these delays can become tiresome.  By default,
Glk AGiliTy will delay for approximately half the time that the game specifies.

You can vary this behavior with command line options: use "-gd" to make all
delays full length; "-gh" to make all delays short, approximately half length;
and "-gn" to turn off delays altogether.  You can also change the delay mode
with "glk delays" while in a game.

When the game is delaying, Glk AGiliTy displays a "Waiting..." indicator on
the right hand side of the second line of any status window.

You can cancel a game delay by pressing the space bar while the "Waiting..."
indicator is active.  This will stop the delay immediately, and also suppress
any further delays the game requests until it issues the next input line
prompt or requests other keyboard input.

A few games might not play correctly with delays turned off, so you should
take a little care with this option.  For example, a game could clear the
screen, print a message, delay for a short time, clear the screen again, and
continue.  With delays turned off, Glk AGiliTy will not get the chance to
display the message.

Glk AGiliTy will not implement game delays if the Glk library does not support
timers.


Interpreting Commands Locally
-----------------------------

Glk AGiliTy will handle special commands if they are prefixed with the string
'glk'.  It understands the following special commands:

	help			Prints help on Glk special commands
	summary			Prints all current Glk settings
	version			Prints the Glk library and Glk port version
				numbers
	license			Prints the Glk port license

	script on		Starts recording the game text output sent
				to the main game window
	script off		Turns off game text recording
	inputlog on		Starts recording input lines typed by the
				player
	inputlog off		Stops recording input lines
	readlog on		Reads an input log file as if it had been
				typed by a player; reading stops automatic-
				ally at the end of the file
	abbreviations on	Turn abbreviation expansion on
	abbreviations off	Turn abbreviation expansion off
	glk fonts auto, or
	glk fonts automatic	Let Glk AGiliTy determine the appropriate
				font for a paragraph automatically
	glk fonts fixed		Print all output in a fixed width font
	glk fonts variable, or
	glk fonts proportional	Print all output in a proportional font
	width			Print the approximate display width; AGT
				games may expect at least 80 characters
	statusline extended	Show a two line, extended status display
	statusline short	Show a single line, short status display
	replacements on		Replace selected interpreter paragraphs with
				improved formatted alternatives
	replacements off	Don't replace selected interpreter paragraphs
	delays full [or on]	Make all delays full length
	delays short [or half]	Make all delays approximately half length
	delays none [or off]	Turns off delays altogether
	commands off		Turn of Glk special commands; once off, there
				is no way to turn them back on

You can abbreviate these commands, as long as the abbreviation you use is
unambiguous.

If for some reason you need to pass the string "glk" to the interpreter, you
can, as with abbreviations above, prefix it with a single quote character.

You can turn off local command handling with the command line option '-gc'.

If both abbreviation expansion and local command handling are turned off, there
is no need to use single quotes to suppress special interpreter features.


Transcripts and Input Logs
--------------------------

AGiliTy games can themselves set up transcripts and input logs.  However, the
meta-verbs to set them up can occasionally conflict with commands in the game.
It may therefore be more convenient to use Glk commands to create these logs.

Any Glk AGiliTy transcript or input log is in addition to those that may be
set up by the main AGiliTy interpreter, so although not wildly useful, it's
possible to create two transcripts and input logs at the same time.


Glk AGiliTy Debug Options
-------------------------

The command line option "-gD" turns on debugging in the AGiliTy Glk I/O module.
The output is really only useful when debugging Glk AGiliTy.

The command line option "-g#" tests for clean program exit.  Glk AGiliTy takes
a couple of liberties with the ANSI rules for exit handler functions.  For
most systems, these don't cause any problems, but for some they might.

To test to see if your system is affected, run Glk AGiliTy with "-g#".  The
program will exit straight away, and if it exits cleanly (no core dumps or
other ugly program termination), everything is fine.  Otherwise, you should
either recompile with GLK_CLEAN_EXIT defined, or set environment variable
GLKAGIL_CLEAN_EXIT to "true".

                Welcome to the
            ALAN ADVENTURE LANGUAGE
                  3.0beta5
                 2015-06-23


THE NEWS IN SHORT:

Alan is a tool to create text adventure games, interactive fiction,
text-based simulations for teaching or other similar types of
interactive software.

This is the third beta version (v3.0beta5) of Alan V3. Alan v3
features many new enhancements especially object orientation.

This package contains at least the compiler and the interpreter. It
might also, depending on the distribution package, include the manual,
the source for the Saviour game, a converter program which takes an
Alan v2 source file and outputs a V3 version of the same source, the
source and binary for a sample game. Read the particulars in the
readme for your platform. If it does not you can find most of that at
the Alan webspace:

      http://www.alanif.se

The changes between versions is described in the file CHANGES, which
should also be included.



THE LONG STORY:

The Alan System is one of the most easy-to-use tools to create
interactive fiction, aka. adventure games. The Alan System is based on
a special purpose computer language designed to be easy to use for
people more interested in authoring and designing games. The system
consists of a compiler, which compiles Alan source to a compact and
portable form, and an interpreter that interprets such a form to allow
playing of the game.

The Alan System is register-ware. To use Alan for authoring and
distributing your games all you need to do is to register. Registration
can be done with a simple email to thomas@alanif.se.

Alan V3 has been evolving for a number of years and is now feature
complete. It is stable enough to use for production type work, but
will be released as a non-beta when enough beta test experience show
that it is mature enough. You can help! Report any problem and
suggestions. You can visit

	http://wwww.alanif.se

to find out more about Alan V3.

You can also find the legacy v2.8 version there. It should now be
considered completely obsolete and you should only look at it if are
looking to run some old game. Otherwise you should *really* look at
V3. Alan may also be found at

	http://www.ifarchive.org

and its mirrors.

For complete copying conditions refer to the file COPYING in the
distribution or the corresponding appendix in the manual.

If you have any problems don't hesitate to contact the author at the
following email address:

BOCFEL(6)		       BSD Games Manual 		     BOCFEL(6)

NAME
     bocfel — Z-machine interpreter ⟨http://bocfel.org/⟩

SYNOPSIS
     bocfel [-cCdDefgGhkmprstUxXyY] [-a eval_stack_size] [-A call_stack_size]
	    [-E escape_string] [-l username] [-n number] [-N version]
	    [-R replay_filename] [-S record_filename] [-T transcript_filename]
	    [-u slots] [-z seed] [-Z device] file
     bocfel -i file
     bocfel -v

DESCRIPTION
     bocfel is a Z-machine interpreter.  It fully supports versions 1-5, 7,
     and 8 of the Z-machine, with extremely limited support for version 6.  It
     can read stories stored in Blorb files, but has no support for associated
     graphics, if any exist.

     The following options are available:

     -a eval_stack_size
	     The Z-machine contains an evaluation stack which games use as a
	     sort of scratch space when performing calculations.  By default
	     the size of this stack is set at 16384, which should be suffi‐
	     cient for any game.  The entire stack is allocated at once, so if
	     you are on a system with a small amount of memory, setting this
	     to a smaller value will cause less memory to be allocated.

	     The maximum value is limited only by system memory.  Each evalua‐
	     tion stack entry takes two bytes.	If you ever encounter a “stack
	     overflow” message with the default size, please let me know.

     -A call_stack_size
	     The Z-machine allows games to call routines in order to get work
	     done; these routines can call other routines, and so on.  Infor‐
	     mation about these routines is placed onto the call stack, which
	     by default has a size of 1024.  This means that no more than 1024
	     routines can be active at any single time.  This value should be
	     much more than sufficient for any game.  As with the evaluation
	     stack, memory for the call stack is allocated at one time, so
	     machines with small amounts of memory can reduce this value to
	     reduce memory consumption.

	     The maximum value allowable by the Z-machine is 65535.  Each call
	     stack entry takes between 40 and 50 bytes.

     -c      If the Glk implementation being used is Gargoyle, or if Glk is
	     not being used at all, support for colors is provided.  This
	     option disables color support entirely.

     -C      Do not read the configuration file $HOME/.bocfelrc.  Settings in
	     the configuration file take precedence over those specified on
	     the command line, so if you want to override the configuration
	     file, use this option.

     -d      Many Glk implementations allow timed input as used by games such
	     as Border Zone.  This option disables timed input and informs
	     games that timed input is not available.

     -D      If Gargoyle is being used, sound effects are supported.  This
	     option disables sound effects and informs games that sound
	     effects are not available.

     -e      Turn on ANSI escapes in the transcript. If this option is
	     enabled, all user input in the transcript can be decorated with
	     ANSI escape sequences so it stands out.  See the -E option.

     -E escape_string
	     If the -e option is used, this sets the escape string that will
	     be used when highlighting user input in the transcript.  ^[[ is
	     written, then escape_string, then ^[[0m.  By default “1m” is used
	     as the escape string, providing bold text.

     -f      Many Glk implementations allow a fixed-width font to be selected.
	     This option disables fixed-width fonts and informs games that
	     fixed-width fonts are not available. The game might still be dis‐
	     played using a fixed-width font (e.g. if you are playing in a
	     terminal), but the game has no way of knowing this.

     -F      Glk does not allow the mixing of text styles, so it is not possi‐
	     ble to request, for example, both fixed-width and reverse video.
	     If both styles are requested, fixed-width takes precedence.  How‐
	     ever, if bocfel is being run in a terminal (with, for example,
	     the glktermw Glk implementation), the font will be fixed at all
	     times.  The -F flag tells bocfel to assume that the current font
	     is always fixed, allowing other styles to be applied simultane‐
	     ously.  See the puzzle pieces in Graham Nelson's Jigsaw for an
	     example of how this can be useful.

	     See also the STYLES section.  Note that Gargoyle does allow the
	     mixing of styles, so this option does nothing under Gargoyle.

     -g      Disable the character graphics font. See the CHARACTER GRAPHICS
	     FONT section below.

     -G      Select an alternative style of box drawing characters.

	     Most characters in the graphics font map fairly well to Unicode
	     equivalents, but a few box drawing characters do not.  Two meth‐
	     ods for drawing the missing characters are provided, each with
	     pros and cons.  A description of the differences is not suffi‐
	     cient, so it is recommended that you try Beyond Zork both with
	     and without this option, paying attention to the map connections.
	     See also the CHARACTER GRAPHICS FONT section below.

     -h      Display a short help message then exit.

     -i      Print out the ID of the specified game and exit. This ID is used
	     to uniquely identify a game and is adapted from the Treaty of
	     Babel standard.  Game IDs can be used in the configuration file
	     to set options for specific games. See the CONFIGURATION FILE
	     section for more information.

     -k      The Z-machine has a concept of “terminating keys”.  When enabled,
	     these keys, in addition to Enter, terminate input immedately.
	     Beyond Zork, for example, uses this so that F1 automatically exe‐
	     cutes “look around”, F2 does “inventory”, and so on.  However,
	     Beyond Zork also claims the up arrow, which means that history
	     browsing, in Glk implementations that support it, might not be
	     able to be initiated with the up arrow.  This option disables the
	     use of terminating keys.  Note that not all Glk implementations
	     support terminating keys.

     -l username
	     Set the username by writing up to 8 bytes to the location 0x38 in
	     the story file. This is not officially part of the Z-machine, but
	     is at least used by Hollywood Hijinx, where a username starting
	     with either “DA” or “TOMAS” enables the debugging command “flush
	     33” which moves you to a junction room which leads to various
	     other locations, allowing puzzles to be bypassed.

     -m      Disable meta commands.  See META COMMANDS below for more informa‐
	     tion.

     -n number
	     Z-machine interpreters are able to inform games what platform
	     they are running on by setting an interpreter number in the range
	     1 to 11.  The following are the valid values (taken from Graham
	     Nelson's Z-Machine Standards Document 1.0):

		   1.	DECSystem-20
		   2.	Apple IIe
		   3.	Macintosh
		   4.	Amiga
		   5.	Atari ST
		   6.	IBM PC
		   7.	Commodore 128
		   8.	Commodore 64
		   9.	Apple IIc
		   10.	Apple IIgs
		   11.	Tandy Color

	     By and large this value is meaningless.  Some Infocom games do
	     make small use of this information: Trinity, for example, has a
	     “print emphasized” routine that is used to print emphasized
	     (which generally means italicized) text; on any machine but the
	     Atari, however, this routine makes sure not to print punctuation
	     in italics.  Beyond Zork makes what is probably the most visible
	     use of the interpreter number, using it to decide how to deal
	     with character graphics. See section 16 of the Z-Machine
	     Standards Document 1.0 for more information.  By default, the
	     interpreter version is set to 1 becuase this causes Beyond Zork
	     to prompt the user about the machine he is using, allowing him to
	     select whether or not character graphics are used.

	     I do not recommend setting this to 11.  At least Beyond Zork
	     assumes that the largest it will be is 10, and setting it to 11
	     can cause an out-of-bounds memory access. The instance I have
	     seen of this is not fatal, but there may be other instances that
	     are.

     -N version
	     Even more meaningless than the interpreter number is the inter‐
	     preter version. This, as far as has been determined, is never
	     used except when the user asks a game to either report its ver‐
	     sion or to verify its disk image. In these cases, the version is
	     simply printed out, nothing more.	This is a single character and
	     there is no real reason to change it. The default is C.

     -p      bocfel includes patches to work around some known bugs in games.
	     This flag disables such patches.

     -r      Play back a command record (see -s) as soon as the game begins.
	     Some games provide a way to play back a record (typically through
	     the REPLAY verb in Inform-based games, and #comm in some Infocom
	     games), but this option is useful to start playback before you
	     have an opportunity to call REPLAY, or if the game provides no
	     way to play back such a record.

	     Command records must be UTF-8.

	     See also the META COMMANDS section.

     -R replay_filename
	     When command-record playback is enabled, you will be prompted for
	     a filename. This prompt can be bypassed by providing a filename
	     here.

     -s      Turn on command recording. This records every keystroke the
	     player makes, and (hopefully) creates a record that is suitable
	     for playback either by using -r or through a game command.  Some
	     games provide this functionality themselves (typically through
	     the RECORDING verb in Inform-based games, and #reco in some Info‐
	     com games), but this option is useful to start recording before
	     you have an opportunity to call RECORDING, or if the game pro‐
	     vides no way to start such a record.

	     Command records are always written in UTF-8.

	     See also the META COMMANDS section.

     -S record_filename
	     When command recording is enabled, you will be prompted for a
	     filename.	This prompt can be bypassed by providing a filename
	     here.

     -t      Turn on transcripting. This records both the output of the game
	     and user input. If the chosen transcript file exists, it will be
	     appended to, not overwritten. This way you can easily continue a
	     transcript every time you come back to a game.

	     Transcripts are always written in UTF-8.

	     See also the -y option and the META COMMANDS section.

     -T transcript_filename
	     When transcripting is enabled, you will be prompted for a file‐
	     name. This prompt can be bypassed by providing a filename here.

     -u slots
	     Some games provide the ability to undo a turn. In fact, some
	     games allow multiple turns to be undone. This option controls how
	     many save slots are available. Unlike the stacks (see -a and -A),
	     save slots are dynamic, meaning that unless a game provides sup‐
	     port for undo, no memory will be used.  However, games that do
	     support undo will typically take a snapshot each turn, causing
	     memory to be allocated.  The size of each snapshot depends on the
	     game and the current state of play. Memory usage is minimized as
	     much as possible: at the beginning of Anchorhead, for example,
	     each slot takes up roughly 900 bytes.  As the game progresses,
	     though, the size of a save slot inevitably will increase: near
	     the end of Anchorhead, my save slots were taking up roughly 4500
	     bytes.

	     Note that Inform-based games (at least by default) do not support
	     multiple undo; two non-V6 Infocom games, to my knowledge, do:
	     Sherlock and Beyond Zork.	However, bocfel includes the ability
	     to perform multiple undo regardless of whether the game provides
	     support for it.  See the META COMMANDS section for more informa‐
	     tion.

	     The default value is 100. A value of zero disables undo, and a
	     negative value provides unlimited undo. This is probably a bad
	     idea.

     -U      One of the ways that undo slots (see -u) save memory is to use
	     compression. On modern machines the compression time is minuscule
	     and not noticeable. On slower systems, however, it is possible
	     that the compression will be noticeable. This option disables
	     compression, but be aware that without compression, the size
	     really balloons: save slots in Anchorhead, with compression, take
	     up about 900 bytes on game startup.  Without compression they
	     take up over 40000 bytes.

     -v      Display version information and show which compile-time options
	     are set.

     -x      Many games include abbreviations for commonly-used commands: x
	     for EXAMINE, g for AGAIN, z for WAIT, and o for OOPS. Some early
	     Infocom games, however, do not provide these.  For these Infocom
	     games, x, g, z, and o are mapped to their respective commands,
	     providing convenient shortcuts for games that don't provide them.
	     If a game requires one of these letters for its own use, these
	     abbreviations can be turned off with -x.

     -X      The Tandy corporation licensed some Infocom games, but apparently
	     The Witness was too scary for them, so some words were changed so
	     as not to offend their ridiculously delicate sensibilities. If
	     you want to laugh at Tandy's insecurities, this flag will turn on
	     their censorship. In addition to the mangling of The Witness, a
	     few other games unnecessarily add mention of Tandy in the output
	     of the VERSION command.

     -y      When transcripting is turned on and an existing file is selected,
	     that file is appended to rather than overwritten. This option
	     causes the file to be overwritten.

     -Y      In almost all games, either the game's UNDO command or the /undo
	     meta command will work.  However, if you encounter a game where
	     undo appears broken, try using this option.  It will instruct
	     bocfel to ignore the game's undo code, instead using only its own
	     undo handling.  This might work if the game's undo handling is
	     subpar, either by design or by accident.  Note that if this
	     option is active, /undo must be used instead of the game's UNDO
	     command.

     -z seed
	     Provide a seed to the pseudo-random number generator, causing it
	     to yield predictable values. This option is probably only of use
	     to game authors who are doing testing.

     -Z device
	     Provide a device from which a seed for the pseudo-random number
	     generator is read.  This is meant to be used with special files
	     such as /dev/urandom, although it can be used with any file from
	     which at least 32 bits can be read.  The -z option overrides this
	     option.

CONFIGURATION FILE
     bocfel allows to you control its behavior through a configuration file.
     This obviates the need to provide command-line arguments each time you
     start a game, as well as allowing customization based on which game is
     being played.

     The configuration file is located in $HOME/.bocfelrc, and a general out‐
     line is as follows:

	   enable_escape = 1
	   disable_color = 1

	   [1-990831-d8b4]
	   disable_color = 0

	   [57-871221]
	   int_number = 1

     The first lines are general, and apply to all games.  The bracketed lines
     start a new group based on the ID contained in the brackets (see the -i
     option).  Thus disable_color is set to zero only for 1-990831-d8b4, and
     int_number is set to 1 only for 57-871221.  Comments begin with a # and
     continue to the end of the line. Trailing whitespace is ignored.

     The following are all the possible options, which are hopefully
     self-explanatory:

	   eval_stack_size (n)
	   call_stack_size (n)
	   disable_color (b)
	   disable_timed (b)
	   enable_escape (b)
	   escape_string (s)
	   disable_fixed (b)
	   assume_fixed (b)
	   disable_graphics_font (b)
	   enable_alt_graphics (b)
	   disable_term_keys (b)
	   username (s)
	   disable_meta_commands (b)
	   max_saves (n)
	   disable_undo_compression (b)
	   int_number (n)
	   int_version (c)
	   disable_patches (b)
	   replay_on (b)
	   replay_name (s)
	   record_on (b)
	   record_name (s)
	   transcript_on (b)
	   transcript_name (s)
	   disable_abbreviations (b)
	   enable_censorship (b)
	   overwrite_transcript (b)
	   override_undo (b)
	   random_seed (n)
	   random_device (s)

     The parenthesized character describes the type of argument: b is a bool‐
     ean (1 is true, 0 is false), c is a character, n is a number, and s is a
     string.  These all correspond to possible command-line arguments.

     In addition to analogs to the command-line arguments, there are a couple
     of other options that can be set through the configuration file.  One is
     “cheat”: see the CHEATING section below.  The other is fine-grained con‐
     trol over colors in Gargoyle; this does not apply to any other build
     types.

     At the most basic, there are 8 colors that the Z-machine can use, corre‐
     sponding to ANSI colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
     and white.  The syntax for setting these is:

	   color_red = 0xc23621

     The color is specified as a 24-bit RGB value, 8 bits per color.  The
     above is thus 0xc2 red, 0x36 green, and 0x21 blue.  The value must be
     specified in hexadecimal, with an optional leading 0x.

STYLES
     The Z-machine allows for different text styles to be selected: these are
     emphasized (typically italicized or underlined), bold, and reverse video.
     In addition, a fixed-width font can be selected.  Glk does not guarantee
     the appearance of styles; it only allows you to select from a list of
     uses, rather than appearances.  The following Glk styles are how bocfel
     maps the Z-machine's text styles:

     Italic (or emphasized) uses the Emphasized style.	Bold uses the Sub‐
     header style.  Reverse video uses the Alert style.  Fixed-width uses the
     Preformatted style.

     These were chosen because they map appropriately in the glktermw Glk
     implementation.  If your Glk implementation does not render these styles
     in a manner you like, consult its documentation to see if it is possible
     to change the appearance of the various Glk styles.

     Gargoyle, although a Glk implementation, does not have these issues.  The
     combination of styles is possible, and the appearance of styles can be
     guaranteed.

CHARACTER GRAPHICS FONT
     Beyond Zork can make use of a character graphics font. This font is used
     for drawing the interactive map, arrows, and runes. Most of the runes and
     arrows have Unicode equivalents and can be displayed if you have a font
     that contains these characters. Unicode also includes box-drawing charac‐
     ters which can be used to approximate the map in Beyond Zork.  These are
     not perfect, but they are not terrible.

     The -g option disables the character graphics font, but unfortunately the
     ability to tell a game that a particular font is unavailable postdates
     Infocom, so this flag will not prevent Beyond Zork from trying to use it.
     Instead, Beyond Zork makes use of the interpreter number (see -n) to
     decide whether to use character graphics. If you are using a font that
     does not provide the necessary Unicode characters, you will want to run
     Beyond Zork without the character graphics font. This is easily accom‐
     plished by answering “No” when the game asks you if you are using a
     VT-220 (this only happens when the interpreter number is set to 1, which
     is the default).

     If the character font is disabled with -g and a game tries to use it any‐
     way (as is the case with Beyond Zork), the output will appear garbled,
     but only for that font. Anything the game prints out in a normal font
     will look fine.

     See section 16 of the Z-Machine Standards Document 1.0 for more informa‐
     tion.

META COMMANDS
     bocfel includes support for “meta commands”, which are commands inter‐
     preted by bocfel itself instead of the game.  These are introduced with a
     slash (‘/’), chosen in an attempt to not clash with game commands.  These
     meta commands can be entered at any point the game requests user input,
     e.g. on each turn.  They are as follows, and are case sensitive:

	   /undo       Undo a turn.  This is similar to the UNDO command some
		       games provide, but has two distinct advantages: it
		       works even in games that do not provide undo, and it
		       provides multiple undo even in games which do not sup‐
		       port multiple undo.

	   /scripton   Start a transcript.

	   /scriptoff  Stop a transcript.

	   /recon      Start a command record.

	   /recoff     Stop a command record.

	   /replay     Replay a command record.

	   /save       Save the game.  This creates save files that are incom‐
		       patible with those created by SAVE, so they should only
		       be restored with /restore.  bocfel has built-in protec‐
		       tion to prevent a file saved with a normal SAVE command
		       from being confused with one saved by /save, and vice
		       versa.

		       Because it creates non-standard save files, this com‐
		       mand should be avoided unless it is absoulutely neces‐
		       sary, e.g. if the game has disabled saving.  It was
		       added to bocfel solely for the case of such anti-social
		       games.

	   /restore    Restore a game saved by /save.  Do not attempt to use
		       /restore to restore games saved with a normal SAVE com‐
		       mand.

	   /ps	       Push a save state onto the in-memory stack.

		       This is meant to serve as an alternative to on-disk
		       save files for when you are trying something dangerous
		       in a game.  In such a case, there is generally no need
		       for a save file to be stored on the disk because the
		       save state is not meant to be persistent: it only needs
		       to last long enough to be restored in the same session.

		       Because a stack is used, /ps can be used multiple
		       times, allowing you to jump backward as many times as
		       there are states.  The maximum number of states stored
		       is 25.  Once this number of states is reached, each new
		       state causes the oldest state to be dropped.

	   /ps [description]
		       Identical to /ps, except that when the save state is
		       displayed by /ls, the supplied description is shown
		       rather than the time of the save.

		       Please note that at the current time, any characters
		       which are not printable ASCII characters will be
		       replaced with a question mark.

	   /pop        Restore the last-stored in-memory save state, as cre‐
		       ated by /ps, removing it from the stack.

	   /pop [slot]
		       Restore the specified in-memory save slot.  [slot] must
		       correspond to one of the slot numbers shown by /ls.
		       The specified save, as well as any newer saves, will be
		       removed from the stack.

	   /drop       Drop the last-stored in-memory save state, as created
		       by /ps, removing it from the stack.

	   /drop [slot]
		       Drop the specified in-memory save slot.	[slot] must
		       correspond to one of the slot numbers shown by /ls.
		       The specified save, as well as any newer saves, will be
		       removed from the stack.

	   /drop all   Drop all in-memory save slots, removing them from the
		       stack.

	   /ls	       List all available in-memory save states.  Each state
		       is shown either as a string representing the time when
		       the state was saved, or, if it was supplied, the
		       description passed to /ps.  The last-listed state,
		       which is marked with an asterisk, is the default state
		       which will be restored with /pop.

	   /status     Display the status line.  This only works for V1, V2,
		       and V3 games, and is meant to be used either in non-Glk
		       mode, or if the Glk implementation being used does not
		       support windows (e.g. cheapglk).

	   /disable    Disable meta commands for the remainder of the session.
		       This is useful if the game itself expects input to
		       start with a slash character.

	   /say [command]
		       Pretend like [command] was typed.  As with /disable,
		       this is meant for games which expect input to start
		       with a slash character.

	   /debug [...]
		       Perform a debugging operation; see META DEBUG COMMANDS.

     Please note that /save and /restore are experimental.

     Mixing in-memory saves with undo can have odd effects.  For example, if a
     save state is pushed, and undo is then called multiple times, returning
     to a point which occurred before the /ps call, popping the save state
     will still jump to the /ps save position, effectively cancelling the undo
     calls.  The undo states will not be recreated.  Similarly, if undo is
     called right after /pop, it will succeed, but will not undo the /pop
     call.  Instead, the effect is the same as if undo had been called on the
     turn before /pop was called.  This is because meta commands are not con‐
     sidered game commands and thus do not cause undo states to be stored.

META DEBUG COMMANDS
     The /debug command starts a debugging operation.  For some debugging
     operations, an address is expected.  This is either an absolute address,
     specified in hexadecimal with an optional leading 0x, or it is a global
     variable.	Global variables have the syntax Gxx, where xx is a hexadeci‐
     mal value in the range [00, ef], corresponding to global variables 0 to
     239.

     The debug commands are as follows:

	   change start
		       Begin a “change” operation.  This tracks word-sized
		       memory addresses, allowing you to see if the values at
		       any addresses have increased or decreased since the
		       last check.  This is primarily useful for cheating (see
		       CHEATING), helping, for example, to determine which
		       memory address is used to track hunger or thirst.

	   change dec  Display a list of all memory addresses which have
		       decreased since the last change operation (either a
		       change start, change inc, or change dec.  Values are
		       treated as signed words, so a change from 0 to 65535 is
		       considered a decrease from 0 to -1.

	   change inc  Display a list of all memory addresses which have
		       decreased since the last change operation.

	   scan start  Begin a “scan” operation.  This tracks word-sized mem‐
		       ory addresses, checking if particular addresses have
		       specific values over time.  As with “change” opera‐
		       tions, this is useful mainly for cheating.  An example
		       would be tracking which memory address holds the amount
		       of money being carried.	If you have $50, you can scan
		       all addresses for the value 50.	After spending $5,
		       scan all addresses for 45.  Repeat until only one
		       address matches and that is likely where the money
		       count is being stored.

	   scan [N]    Scan all memory addresses for the value N, which is a
		       signed decimal integer (hexadecimal if a leading 0x is
		       used, octal if a leading 0 is used).  The total number
		       of matching addresses (constrained by previous scan
		       operations) is then printed.

	   scan show   Display all addresses matching all previous scan crite‐
		       ria.  This is a separate operation because initial
		       scans will potentially match thousands of addresses.

	   print [address]
		       Print the word (as both signed decimal and unsigned
		       hexadecimal) at address.

	   freeze [address] [value]
		       Freeze a 16-bit value in memory; this is analogous to
		       the freeze configuration variable (see CHEATING).
		       address is the address to freeze, and value is the
		       value it should be frozen to.  value can be decimal,
		       hexadecimal, or octal, with a leading 0x signifying
		       hexadecimal and a leading 0 signifying octal.

		       Please note that it is possible for bocfel to be built
		       without cheating support, so this and related commands
		       might not work.

	   unfreeze [address]
		       Unfreeze the 16-bit value which is frozen at address;
		       the address is parsed identically as for freeze.  It is
		       not an error to unfreeze an unfrozen value.

	   show_freeze
		       Display all frozen values.

	   watch [address]
		       Report any changes to the 16-bit word at address.

		       Please note that it is possible for bocfel to be built
		       without watch support, so this and related commands
		       might not work.

	   watch all   Watch every address for changes.  This will likely pro‐
		       duce a lot of output.

	   unwatch [address]
		       Stop watching address for changes.  It is not an error
		       to stop watching an address which is not being watched.

	   unwatch all

	   show_watch  Display all watched-for values.

SOUND EFFECTS
     Currently, sound effects are only available when Gargoyle is used as the
     Glk implementation.  The sound effects should be bundled in a Blorb file.
     If the story file itself is stored in a Blorb file, that file is used to
     find the sound effects.  Otherwise, a separate Blorb file must exist and
     be named as follows: if the story file is /foo/bar/sherlock.z5, then the
     Blorb file must be /foo/bar/sherlock.blb.	Sound effect support is exper‐
     imental and does not currently conform fully to the Z-machine standard.
     Bleeps are not supported, nor is section 9.4.4, nor is the hack regarding
     The Lurking Horror mentioned in the Remarks section.

CHEATING
     There is extremely rudimentary support for “cheating”.  bocfel is able to
     freeze certain areas of memory so that they always report the same value.
     The idea behind this is to prevent hunger and thirst counters from forc‐
     ing you to eat and drink.

     Cheating is available through the configuration file as well as through
     meta debug commands (see META DEBUG COMMANDS for information on using
     meta debug commands to cheat).

     When the configuration file is used, cheats are treated like any other
     configuration variable.  The syntax is as follows: freeze:address:value.

     This causes the word (an unsigned 16-bit value) at address address to
     always contain the value value; value can be decimal, hexadecimal, or
     octal, with a leading 0x signifying hexadecimal and a leading 0 signify‐
     ing octal.

     Example:

	   cheat = freeze:0xabcd:0
	   cheat = freeze:G00:0

     Visit http://bocfel.org/cheats/ for a list of a few cheats for some Info‐
     com games.  More cheats are potentially discoverable using meta debug
     commands (see the META DEBUG COMMANDS section).  A more detailed explana‐
     tion of how to figure out cheats is beyond the scope of this document.

     Please note that it is possible for bocfel to be built without support
     for cheating, in which case these cheats will silently do nothing.  The
     -v option can be used to determine whether this is the case.

Git is an interpreter for the Glulx virtual machine. Its homepage is here:

http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXglulxXinterpretersXgit.html

Git's main goal in life is to be fast. It's about five times faster than Glulxe,
and about twice as fast as Frotz (using the same Inform source compiled for the
Z-machine). It also tries to be reasonably careful with memory: it's possible to
trade speed off against memory by changing the sizes of Git's internal buffers.

I wrote Git because I want people to be able to write huge games or try out
complicated algorithms without worrying about how fast their games are going to
run. I want to play City of Secrets on a Palm without having to wait ten seconds
between each prompt.

Have fun, and let me know what you think!

* Credits

Andrew Plotkin invented Glulx, so obviously Git wouldn't exist without him. I
also reused some code from his Glulxe interpreter (glkop.c and search.c), which
saved me a lot of time and let me concentrate on the more interesting stuff.

Many thanks are due to John Cater, who not only persuaded me to use source
control, but let me use his own CVS server. John also provided lots of useful
advice and encouragement, as did Sean Barrett.

Thanks also to Joe Mason, Adam Thornton, Simon Baldwin and Joonas Pihlaja who
were among the first to try it out and complain that it wasn't working. Joonas
also gets special brownie points for trying out more bizarre boundary cases than
I realised existed in the first place.

Tor Andersson was apparently the first person to use setmemsize, since he also
explained why it didn't work and contributed a fix. Thanks, Tor!

David Kinder has done a stellar job of maintaining the code recently. Thanks
also to Eliuk Blau for tracking down bugs in the memory management opcodes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES ON GLK HUGO
-----------------

This is a port of Hugo to Glk, the multi-platform interface layer designed
by Andrew Plotkin, which enables Hugo to run on platforms to which it has
not been directly ported.

Because Glk does not itself support all of Hugo's features, the limitations
of Glk Hugo on various platforms may include any or all of:

	- No graphics display
	- No sound or music
	- No colored text
	- No arbitrary window positioning
	- Main display limited to a proportional font
	- Windows limited to fixed-fonts

However, most Hugo games should work, since Glk Hugo makes every attempt to
gracefully work around these features even if they are used.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- With mouse-based versions of Glk, it may be possible to change the window
focus by clicking in a different window.  If you are unable to type a
command when Glk Hugo seems to be waiting for one, try clicking on the input
window to restore focus.

Inform Release Notes

Inform Compiler 6.34, 6.33, 6.32, 6.31, 6.30
Inform Library 6/11

Introduction

This is a maintenance release of the Inform system for creating adventure
games, intended to address issues that have arisen since the 6.21 compiler and
6/10 library files were released in 1999, and subsequently since the 6.30
compiler was released in 2004. The focus is primarily on fixing problems, but a
small number of enhancements are included.

Although just about all known bugs are fixed, the approach to enhancing Inform
is more conservative. The selection of suggestions to implement has been
governed by three factors:

    * avoidance of changes which might cause existing games to misbehave;

    * minimisation of features which would require updates to the Inform
Designer’s Manual;

    * essential simplicity. With Graham Nelson’s permission, this release has
been produced by a volunteer taskforce, whose enthusiasm has been tempered by a
certain lack of familiarity with the internals of Inform. Thus, we have
concentrated on ‘safe’ changes; the implementation of some good ideas has been
postponed until we are more confident that we know what we’re doing.

Having said that, this release does incorporate one major advance. It is based
on Andrew Plotkin’s bi-platform — Z-machine and Glulx — compiler and library
files, which were in turn derived from the the 6.21 compiler and 6/10 library.
The result is that the two Virtual Machine (VM) strands have merged into a
single compiler and library which, although continuing by default to produce
Z-code, can alternatively generate code for the Glulx VM if you supply the -G
compiler switch. There’s more on this topic in Support for Glulx. Before that,
though, we’ll summarise the changes to the compiler and to the library files.

If you’ve translated the 6/10 library into another language, you may find
Information for translators helpful.

Acknowledgements

Far too many people contributed towards this release — reporting and resolving
bugs, making helpful suggestions, providing support and facilities, testing,
and so on — for their names to be individually listed. So instead, this is a
general thank-you to everybody who has made this release happen, and specific
ones to Graham for permitting it in the first place, and to Andrew for his
pioneering work on Glulx. There are, naturally, sure to be imperfections in the
release, and these should be reported through the Inform bug tracker.

        Level 9 Interpreter v5.1
        An interpreter for Level 9 games in any format,
        including Spectrum snapshots.

        Simon Baldwin, Dieter Baron and Andreas Scherrer.

Introduction
------------

During the 1980s a small British company called Level 9, run by two brothers
(Mike and Pete Austin), produced a series of text adventure games for a
variety of computers. These games received considerable critical acclaim and
are probably the best text adventures written for the small cassette based 8
bit computers common in Britain in the 80s.

Level 9 wrote their games using a custom designed system known as "A-Code",
which evolved from games on the 8 bit computers such as the Acorn BBC Model
B, the Sinclair Spectrum and the Commodore 64 to the (then new) 16 bit
machines such as the Amiga and the Atari ST.

From disassembly of Level 9 games there are thought to be four variants of
A-Code, which are detailed below, and all of which are supported by this
interpreter. Thanks go to Paul David Doherty for analysing the games and
producing the table which follows.

  v1    This was used for the earliest games. Spectrum v1 games had
        black text on a grey background. Games known to be released in
        this format:

                Colossal Adventure
                Adventure Quest
                Dungeon Adventure
                Snowball
                Lords of Time

  v2    These releases were made between 1984 and 1985 (and usually say
        so in the initial copyright message). This version introduced
        the yellow text on a black background which became standard.
        Games in this format were:

                Adventure Quest
                Dungeon Adventure
                Lords of Time
                Snowball
                Return to Eden
                Erik the Viking
                Emerald Isle
                Red Moon

  v3    This format, dated 1986, was used by the largest number of
        releases. These were:

                Worm in Paradise
                The Price of Magick
                The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole
                The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole
                The Archers
                The Jewels of Darkness Trilogy (Colossal Adventure,
                Adventure Quest and Dungeon Adventure released as
                one package)
                The Silicon Dreams Trilogy
                (Snowball, Return to Eden and Worm in Paradise)

  v4    This was used for the Time and Magick Trilogy (Lords of Time,
        Red Moon and The Price of Magick), and all Level 9's new games
        from 1987 onwards:

                Knight Orc
                Gnome Ranger
                Ingrid's Back
                Lancelot
                Scapeghost


Supported Formats
-----------------

On several machines (such as the Amiga) Level 9 games were distributed as
an interpreter plus a data file, usually called "gamedata.dat" or something
similar. These games can be played with this interpreter simply by loading
the "gamedata.dat" file.

For the Amiga (and some other formats) the v4 games were released in three
parts, each in a separate data file:

        gamedat1.dat
        gamedat2.dat
        gamedat3.dat

Starting the first game gives a menu from which you can choose which part or
game to play. For this to work the files must have the same basic structure
with a number in it somewhere, e.g. file names

        TimeAndMagick1.dat
        TimeAndMagick2.dat
        TimeAndMagick3.dat

will work.

On other (especially older and smaller) computers the games were distributed
as a single file containing both an interpreter and the game data. Level9
can cope with these files as well, as it automatically searches files for
valid Level 9 games. This however requires that the file not be compressed
in any way. For example, there are several Spectrum snapshots of Level 9
games available which this interpreter can play, but these snapshots must
be in an uncompressed format (e.g. SNA). Commonly snapshots are available in
the compressed Z80 format, but these files can be converted to SNA using the
widely available conversion program "SPConv". Version 1.06 or higher of
"SPConv" is recommended.

Paul David Doherty has written "L9Cut", which can extract Level 9 games from
many different formats. L9Cut can also remove copy protection from Level 9
games. L9Cut can be downloaded from

  http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXlevel9Xtools.html

This program has been tested on files obtained from releases for the Amiga,
Atari ST, IBM PC, C-64, Spectrum, Atari 800, BBC, Amstrad CPC, Apple 2,
Apple Mac and MSX computers.


Graphics
--------

The first games from Level 9 were text only, but later games included line-
drawn graphics, and then bitmap graphics for the last games. These graphics
are supported by some versions of the interpreter (The 32-bit DOS version
does support graphics, while the 16-bit DOS version does not.).

On some platforms the line-drawn graphics were placed into separate files
(For example, in the Amiga release of "Jewels of Darkness" the game is in
"gamedata.dat" and the graphics in "picture.dat".). In order to show these
pictures the graphics file can be passed as a second command line argument
when starting the interpreter. If no graphics file is specified in this
way, the interpreter will look for a file with the same name as the game
data, but with a file extension of ".pic", ".cga" or ".hrc" (the latter
two being used for graphics files in MS-DOS Level 9 releases).

If no line-drawn graphics file is specified, Level 9 will search the given
game data file for graphics data. This is useful when the game data is a
Spectrum SNA snapshot or a similar memory dump of an emulator.

The last Level 9 games use bitmap graphics. The interpreter can display the
bitmap graphics from C64, Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Apple Macintosh, BBC B,
Amstrad CPC and Spectrum +3 versions of the games (though for the last three,
there is currently no way to extract the A-code game data in a usable form).

The graphics files contain a number somewhere in the file name, and there
may also be a title picture with a different file name. The interpreter
searches for suitably named graphics files using the following rules. In
all cases copy the graphics and title files to the same directory as the
game.

Amiga, Macintosh and some Atari ST
  The graphics file name is just the number (e.g. "1", "2", etc.).
  The title file is called "title".

Later Atari ST
  The graphics file name is the number with a "squ" file extension
  (e.g. "1.squ", "2.squ", etc.). The title file is just one of the
  normal graphics files.

MS-DOS
  The graphics file name is the number with a "pic" file extension
  (e.g. "1.pic", "2.pic", etc.). The title file is just one of the
  normal graphics files.

C64
  The graphics file name is "pic" followed by the number (e.g.
  "pic1", "pic2", etc.). The title file is called "title mpic".

BBC B "Lancelot"
  As for C64, except that the title file is called "title".

BBC B except "Lancelot"
  The graphics file name is "P.Pic" followed by the number (e.g.
  "P.Pic1", "P.Pic2", etc.). The title file is called "P.Title".

Amstrad CPC and Spectrum +3
  All but the first graphic are contained in a single file called
  "allpics.pic". The first graphics file is "1.pic" and the title
  file is "title.pic".


Meta Commands
-------------

Level9 supports several meta commands, which can be entered on the input
line. These commands are handled by the interpreter rather than being passed
to the game. They are:

  #save         Saves out a game position directly, bypassing any
                prompting (such as for disk changes).

  #restore      Loads in a saved position directly, bypassing any
                protection code within the game.

  #quit         Quits the current game.

  #cheat        Tries to bypass the copy protection code which asks for
                a specific word. This is done by trying every word in
                the game's dictionary. On a slow machine, this can take
                a long time.

  #dictionary   Lists the game dictionary. Press a key to stop the
                listing and return to the input line.

  #picture      If graphics are available, shows the picture specified
                as a number after the picture command, e.g. "#picture 520".

  #seed         Sets the seed of the random number generator to the value
                given, e.g. "#seed 42". This will make randomness within
                the game predictable, which is useful for testing.

  #play         Prompts the user for a text file from which to read
                further input from. Input lines are read from the file
                until the end is reached, at which point the game reverts
                to asking the user for input.

The 32-bit DOS version of Level 9 also supports several hotkeys. Press
Alt-H when playing a game to view a list of the available hotkeys.


History
-------

  v5.1  The bitmap graphics from the US Macintosh release of Lancelot
        now display correctly.

  v5.0  V1 games are also now supported.
        The input logic now correctly handles commas and full stops
        in the user's input for v3 or later games.
        The input logic now allows hyphens and apostrophes to be
        input, which is needed for some v2 games.
        The dictionary listing for v2 games no longer has junk on the
        end.
        The graphics detection algorithm has been improved, so that it
        now correctly finds graphics in all known games.
        A difference in the logic between the v2 and v3 line-drawn
        graphics has been implemented, which corrects the scaling for
        some v2 graphics.
        Added #seed and #play meta commands.

  v4.1  Corrected a bug that made Lancelot unplayable.
        BBC B bitmaps are now shown as they appeared on the original
        computer.

  v4.0  Implemented support for bitmap graphics.

  v3.0  Implemented support for line-drawn graphics.
        Fixed a problem with v4 detection that stopped some versions of
        Scapeghost running correctly.
        Implemented an opcode used by the disk based versions of
        Time and Magick, which now means that saving from these games
        works.
        The interpreter now gives you a reasonable amount of time to
        enter the Lenslok code in protected games, and also tells you
        what the code should be.

  v2.0  Revised the description of v4 games to include all the post-1987
        games, which are now supported.
        V2 games are also now supported.
        Added meta commands.

  v1.0  First release.


Credits
-------

The Level9 interpreter was originally written by Glen Summers. The changes for
version 3.0 were made by David Kinder with additional code from Alan Staniforth
and Simon Baldwin.

For version 4.0, David Kinder integrated the various bitmap decoders, but all
the difficult work was done by Alan Staniforth and Dieter Baron. Alan also
supplied the BBC B bitmap changes for version 4.1.

David and Andreas Scherrer worked on version 5.0 to integrate script playback
from Andreas' .NET port of the interpreter. Andreas created a test harness to
play through all the games, and David and Andreas then worked through the
problems this showed up. Andreas also put much effort into painstakingly
checking all the graphics in the games, which revealed several issues.

Help, testing and information on the various Level 9 formats was provided by
Paul David Doherty. Testing of the fix for Lancelot in version 4.1 was
performed by Guido Mureddu.

Level 9 Interpreter, Glk Notes
------------------------------


Introduction
------------

This is a port of the Level 9 interpreter to Glk.  The complete interface
lives in the single file

	glk.c

The main test and development system for the port is Linux, with Xglk as the
Glk library.


Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to Alan Staniforth for considerable help with getting the some of the
source for the base interpreter together, and for his hints on how to cover
the porting requirements, and to David Kinder for a complete reality check on
the port progress, and also for the Level 9 interpreter.

Thanks also to Ben Hines <bhines@alumni.ucsd.edu> for the Mac code, which, if
I have transcribed it correctly from earlier work with AGiliTy, should permit
this port to run on Mac platforms with Glk.


Running Games
-------------

The interpreter understands game files that use the "Spectrum snapshot" format.
A file in this format usually has the extension ".sna" or ".SNA".

Give the name of the game file to run at the system prompt.  For example

	glklevel9 colossal.sna

If the game has an external line drawing graphics file, make sure that the file
lives in the same directory as the game file, and has the same base name with
the extension ".pic", or is named "picture.dat".  The Glk interpreter will
find this file automatically, if it exists, and use it to create game pictures.
Line drawn graphics are not always held in an external graphics file; a game
may l hold its graphics internally, in which case no addtional files are
required.

If the game has external bitmap pictures, these will normally appear as
multiple files with ".pic", ".squ", ".picN", or ".title" extensions.  As with
line drawn graphics, ensure that these files are in the same directory as the
main game file, so that the Glk interpreter can find them.

If there are no graphics files, the interpreter will run in text only mode.  It
will also do this if it cannot open the graphics files, or if the files do not
seem to contain usable game graphics.

There are a few command line options that you can also add, to vary the way
that the game looks:

	-np     Don't display game pictures initially
	-ni	Don't intercept 'quit', 'restart', 'save', and 'restore'
	-ne	Don't add an extra prompt on line input
	-nl	Don't attempt to detect infinite loops in games
	-na	Don't expand single-letter abbreviations
	-nc	Don't attempt to interpret selected commands locally

See below for further information about what these options mean.


Intercepting Game Commands
--------------------------

Some Level 9 games are written for cassette tape based microprocessor systems,
and the way in which they save, restore, and restart games generally reflects
this.  Additionally, there's often no straightforward way to quit from a game.

To try to make things a bit more convenient for a player, Glk Level 9 traps the
following command words in its interface:

	quit, restart, save, restore, and load (synonym for restore)

When it sees one of these entered on an input line, it tries to handle the
command itself.  In the case of "quit" and "restart", it will confirm that you
want to end the current game.

In the case of "save" and "restore", Glk Level 9 will try to handle saving or
loading game state to or from system files using the Level 9 interpreter
internal routines, rather than the ones built into the game itself.  This
bypasses the inconvenient "Lenslok" check built into some games, and also works
round a couple of possible Level 9 interpreter bugs.

If you prefix a command with a single quote, Glk Level 9 will not try to handle
the command itself, but will remove the quote, and pass the remaining string
to the game without change.

You can turn off command interception with the command line option '-ni'.


Extra Prompting
---------------

Early Level 9 games generally output a prompt something like

	What now?

However, it's not always printed when the game is expecting line input.  Simply
leaning on the Return key will scroll the game with no prompting, and the
Adrian Mole games offer no prompt at all when not in menu modes.

Some later Level 9 games begin with the "What now?" (or "What gnow?"), then
switch to issuing a "> " prompt later on.

To try to make it a little clearer to see what's going on, the Glk Level 9 will
add it's own "> " prompt when the game is expecting line input, but only when
it determines that the game has not already issued its own prompt.

You can turn this off with the '-ne' option.


Displaying Pictures
-------------------

Level 9 games may contain graphics, and while not essential to the game, they
can enhance the experience of playing.

Unfortunately, Glk does not provide a method to directly display an image
bitmap, so Glk Level 9 needs to adopt some tricks to get a picture to display.
The end result is that, on Linux Xglk at least, it can take several seconds to
render a complete picture.

To reduce the problems caused by a game pausing for several seconds for a
picture,  Glk Level 9 does its picture rendering using a background "thread".
This draws in the complete picture over a series of smaller image updates,
while at the same time still allowing game play.  To speed up picture
rendering, Glk Level 9 also goes to considerable effort to try to minimize the
amount of Glk graphics operations it uses.

If you move to a location with a new picture before the current one has been
fully rendered, Glk Level 9 will simply start working on the newer picture.

Most Level 9 games accept the "graphics" and "text" commands, which turn
pictures on and off respectively.  It is also possible to turn off pictures
directly in Glk, for games that don't support these two commands.

You can use the "-np" option to turn off pictures.  Glk Level 9 also will not
show pictures if the Glk library does not support both graphics and timers, if
there are no graphics files, built in graphics, or bitmaps, or if the
interpreter cannot open graphics files successfully.  See below for further
notes about displaying pictures.


Game Infinite Loop Checking
---------------------------

Some Level 9 games can enter an infinite loop if they have nothing better to
do.  For example, at then end of Adrian Mole, you have the option to play the
last part again.  If you decline, the game will spin in a tight loop which
does nothing.

Because it's hard to break into this loop without killing the interpreter
completely, Glk Level 9 notes how much work the interpreter is doing over time.
If it notices that the interpreter has neither printed anything nor asked for
input for five seconds or so, it assumes that the game is in an infinite loop,
and offers you the chance to stop the game.

In the unlikely event that this check triggers with a game that is not in an
infinite loop, you can turn off the option with "-nl".


Status Line
-----------

Level 9 games do not print a status line, so Glk Level 9 will use the status
window, a separate window above the main window created by Glk libraries that
support separate windows, to display the game's name and version details.

For other Glk libraries, Glk Level 9 will print the game's name in "[...]"
brackets above the standard game output following each turn, but only when the
game name has changed since the last turn (that is, in multi-file games).


Expanding Abbreviations
-----------------------

Many IF games systems allow a player to use single character abbreviations for
selected common commands, for example, 'x' for 'examine', 'l' for look, and so
on.  Not all Level 9 games offer this feature, however.

To try to help the player, Glk Level 9 will automatically expand a selection
of single character commands, before passing the expanded string to the game as
input.  It expands a command only if the first word of the command is a single
letter, and one of the following:

	'c' -> "close"		'g' -> "again"		'i' -> "inventory"
	'k' -> "attack"		'l' -> "look"		'p' -> "open"
	'q' -> "quit"		'r' -> "drop"		't' -> "take"
	'x' -> "examine" 	'y' -> "yes"		'z' -> "wait"

If you want to suppress abbreviation expansion, you can prefix your input with
a single quote character (like putting literal strings into a spreadsheet).
If you do this, Glk Level 9 will strip the quote, then pass the rest of the
string to the main interpreter without any more changes.  So for example,

	'x something

will pass the string "x something" back to the game, whereas

	x something

will pass "examine something" back to the game.

You can turn off abbreviation expansions with the command line option '-na'.


Interpreting Commands Locally
-----------------------------

Glk Level 9 will handle special commands if they are prefixed with the string
'glk'.  It understands the following special commands:

	help		  Prints help on Glk special commands
	summary		  Prints all current Glk settings
	version		  Prints the Glk library and Glk port version numbers
	license		  Prints the Glk port license

	script on	  Starts recording the game text output sent to the
			  main game window
	script off	  Turns off game text recording
	inputlog on	  Starts recording input lines typed by the player
	inputlog off	  Stops recording input lines
	readlog on	  Reads an input log file as if it had been typed by
			  a player; reading stops automatically at the end of
			  the file
	abbreviations on  Turn abbreviation expansion on
	abbreviations off Turn abbreviation expansion off
	graphics on       Turn on Glk graphics
	graphics off      Turn off Glk graphics (see below)
	loopchecks on	  Turn game infinite loop checking on
	loopchecks off	  Turn game infinite loop checking off
	locals on	  Turn local interception of 'quit', 'restart',
			  'save' and 'restore' on
	locals off	  Turn local interception of 'quit', etc. off
	prompts on	  Turn extra "> " prompting on
	prompts off	  Turn extra "> " prompting off
	commands off	  Turn of Glk special commands; once off, there is no
			  way to turn them back on

You can abbreviate these commands, as long as the abbreviation you use is
unambiguous.

If for some reason you need to pass the string "glk" to the interpreter, you
can, as with abbreviations above, prefix it with a single quote character.

You can turn off local command handling with the command line option '-nc'.

If all of abbreviation expansion, local command handling, and game command
interceptions are turned off, there is no need to use single quotes to suppress
special interpreter features.


Multi-file Games
----------------

Some Level 9 games come in multiple files, for example

	gamedat1.sna
	gamedat2.sna
	...

and so on.  Once a game part is finished, the Level 9 interpreter queries the
Glk interface for the next file.  When this happens, both for disk and for
tape based games, the interface will try to generate the appropriate file name
for the next game part, by incrementing the last digit found in the file's
name.  The interpreter will then look in the same directory for the new file
name.

If this method fails, then you will need to run the separate game parts
manually.  Alternatively, rename the files so that they match this pattern.


Keyboard Polling
----------------

Some Level 9 games use the standard home microprocessor system method of
waiting for a keypress, using a tight spin loop that samples the keyboard until
a key is detected.  The Adrian Mole games use this keyboard sampling both for
scroll pausing, and for their main menu selections, with something like:

	for each line in the output paragraph
		print the line
		while (os_readchar() shows a key is pressed)
			;
		endwhile
	endfor
	selection = return value from os_readchar()
	while (selection shows no key is pressed)
		selection = return value from os_readchar()
	handle selection...

This means that os_readchar() _must_ be implemented according to the notes in
Level 9's porting.txt.  That is, it must poll the keyboard for key presses,
and return the key code if a key is pressed, or zero if no key is currently
pressed.

If os_readchar() waits for a key press on each call, Adrian Mole games will
wait for a key press after each output line, which is not what we want.  On the
other hand, if it doesn't wait for a key press at the menu selection point, the
interpreter will consume all the available system CPU time, which is also very
undesirable on a multi-tasking operating system.

To solve this, Glk Level 9 uses two different techniques, and which it chooses
depends on whether the Glk library it is linked with has timers.

If the Glk library has timers, then on each call to os_readchar(), Glk Level 9
starts a timeout for a short period, then waits for either a key press event,
or a timeout.  If it receives a key press, it returns the code, otherwise it
returns zero.  This lets games run correctly.  Continually cycling through the
Glk timeout is fast enough to be acceptable to a player, but the timeout
provides good protection against spinning wildly in a tight loop.

If the Glk library does not have timers, then the interface will return zero
for some large number of consecutive calls, then wait until a character is
entered.  Since the initial number is large, this allows the game to progress,
generally, to the point where it needs a key press to continue at all.  The
only thing that might show slightly odd behaviour is the DEMO mode of Adrian
Mole games.

Also, this type of character polling cannot be used with reading input logs.
So the Glk "readlog" command does not function with Adrian Mole games.

To pretend that no key was pressed, when the interface is in fact waiting for
a key press, you can type Control-U.  The Glk interface will return this to
the game as a zero.

Games that rarely, or never, use line input, but continually poll for input
using os_readchar(), are difficult to stop.  To help with this, Glk Level 9
offers Control-C as as way to quit the game, with a confirmation as for "quit"
above.  Note that Control-C will only work when the game is using os_readchar()
(that is, most of the time for Adrian Mole games, and occasionally, if ever,
in other games).  For normal line input, use "quit" as described above.

Control-C is turned off by the command line option "-nc".


A Few Last Words on Graphics
----------------------------

When turning graphics on and off with Glk commands, you should pay special
attention to whether graphics are turned on or off in the game.  In order for
graphics to be displayed, they must be turned on both in the game AND in Glk.
Turning off graphics in Glk is a little more permanent than turning them off
in a game; in fact, some games don't seem to allow you to turn off graphics
within the game at all.

Why a secondary Glk way to turn off pictures?  Well, Level 9 games don't always
behave the same way with the "graphics" and "text" commands, so a control
inside Glk Level 9 itself gives a more consistent way to turn graphics on and
off.  The command

	glk graphics

with no on/off argument, prints out a brief information about the current state
of a game's graphics.  In practice, it's probably best to stick to just one
method of turning graphics on and off -- either the game's own way, or the
'glk graphics' command if the former is not available.

Glk Level 9 does not display all of the line drawn graphics correctly in a
handful of games.  Games known to not display all graphics fully correctly are
"Erik the Viking" (Spectrum, v2), "Return to Eden" (Spectrum48, v3), and
"Price of Magik" (Spectrum48, v3).

Unsere Schriften sind frei im Sinne der GPL, d.h. (stark vereinfacht) dass Veränderungen an der Schriftart erlaubt sind unter der Bedingung, dass diese wieder der Öffentlichkeit unter gleicher Lizenz freigegeben werden. Querdenker behaupten oft, dass bei der Verwendung einer GPL-Schrift eingebettet in beispielsweise eine PDF auch diese freigestellt werden müsse. Deshalb gibt es die sogenannte "Font-exception" der GPL (welche diesem Lizenztext hinzugefügt wurde). Weitere Informationen zur GPL (Lizenztext mit Font-Exzeption als GPL.txt in diesem Paket).

Our fonts are free in the sense of the GPL. In short: Changing the font is allowed as long as the derivative work is published under the same licence again. Pedantics keep claiming that the embedded use of GPL-fonts in i.e. PDFs requires the free publication of the PDF as well. This is why our GPL contains the so called "font exception".

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (with font exception)
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font, and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

Magnetic Scrolls Interpreter, Glk Notes
---------------------------------------


Introduction
------------

This is a port of the Magnetic Scrolls interpreter to Glk.  The complete
interface lives in the single file

	glk.c

The main test and development system for the port is Linux, with Xglk as the
Glk library.


Acknowledgments
---------------

Thanks to David Kinder for hints and tips on how to go about the port, and of
course to Niclas Karlsson and his collaborators for the underlying Magnetic
Scrolls interpreter, which looks like it probably wasn't a lot of fun to work
on at times.

Thanks also to Ben Hines <bhines@alumni.ucsd.edu> for the Mac code.  I've
copied in from AGiliTy with, I think, the appropriate modifications, but it's
untested at present.


Running Games
-------------

The interpreter understands game files that use the "Magnetic Scrolls" data
format.  A file in this format usually has the extension ".MAG" or ".mag", and
has "MaSc" in its first four data bytes.

Give the name of the game file to run at the system prompt.  For example

	glkmagnetic GUILD.MAG

If the game has an associated graphics file, normally a file that has the
extension ".GFX" or ".gfx", make sure that it is in the same directory as the
main data file, and has the same base name.  For example, the matching graphics
file for "GUILD.MAG" is "GUILD.GFX".  The Glk interpreter will find this file
automatically, if it exists, and use it to create game pictures.

The game may also have an associated hints file, with the extension ".HNT" or
".hnt".  Like the graphics file, make sure it is in the same directory as other
game files, and with the same base name, and the Glk interpreter will find the
file automatically.  Hints files apply only to the later Magnetic Windows
games, so not all the games you find will have them.  Also, hints for several
games may be combined into a single file, so you might need to copy, or link,
a file such as "COLL.HNT" to "CCORRUPT.HNT" to match with a "CCORRUPT.MAG"
file.

If there is no graphics file, the interpreter will run in text only mode.  It
will also do this if it cannot open the graphics file, or if the file does not
seem to contain game graphics.

If there is no hints file, the interpreter will not be able to display game
hints, but will otherwise run normally.

As a short cut, you can omit the game extension, so for example

	xmagnetic GUILD

will run GUILD.MAG, and also use pictures from GUILD.GFX, and hints from
GUILD.HNT, if either or both are available.

Because of the way the Glk interpreter looks for files, you should make sure
that the games are held in files with ".MAG" or ".mag" extensions, and any
associated graphics and hints are held in files with ".GFX" or ".gfx" and
".HNT" or ".hnt" extensions respectively.  Games held in files with other
extensions may not work.

There are a few command line options that you can add to vary the way that
the game looks:

	-np	Don't display game pictures initially
	-ng	Don't automatically gamma correct game picture colours
	-nx	Don't animate game pictures
	-ne	Don't add an extra prompt on line input
	-na	Don't expand single-letter abbreviations
	-nc	Don't attempt to interpret selected commands locally

See below for further information about what these options mean.


Extra Prompting
---------------

Magnetic Scrolls games always prompt with ">" when they are expecting input.
However, Magnetic Windows ones are sometimes strangely silent, for example
after receiving an empty line, they don't issue a second prompt.

To try to make it a little clearer to see what's going on, Glk Magnetic will
add its own ">" prompt when the game is expecting line input, but only when it
determines that the game has not already issued its own prompt.

You can turn this off with the '-ne' option.


Displaying Pictures
-------------------

Magnetic Scrolls games generally come with attractive graphics, and while not
essential to the game, they do enhance the experience of playing.

Unfortunately, Glk does not provide a method to directly display an image
bitmap, so Glk Magnetic needs to adopt some tricks to get a picture to display.
The end result is that, on Linux Xglk at least, it can take several seconds to
render a complete picture.

To reduce the problems caused by a game pausing for several seconds for a
picture,  Glk Magnetic does its picture rendering using a background "thread".
This draws in the complete picture over a series of smaller image updates,
while at the same time still allowing game play.  To speed up picture
rendering, Glk Magnetic also goes to considerable effort to try to minimize
the amount of Glk graphics operations it uses.

If you move to a location with a new picture before the current one has been
fully rendered, Glk Magnetic will simply start working on the newer picture.

Most Magnetic Windows and Magnetic Scrolls games accept the "graphics" command,
which toggles pictures on and off.  Magnetic Scrolls games usually start with
graphics enabled, but for some reason Magnetic Windows games tend to start
with graphics disabled.  To get pictures, type "graphics" as more or less the
first game command.

You can use the "-np" option to turn off pictures.  Glk Magnetic also will not
show pictures if the Glk library does not support both graphics and timers, if
there is no suitable ".GFX" or ".gfx" graphics file, or if the interpreter
cannot open the graphics file successfully.  See below for further notes about
displaying pictures.


Animated Pictures
-----------------

Some of the pictures in later Magnetic Windows games are animated, and Glk
Magnetic will animate those pictures.

Animations stretch the bitmap display capabilities of Glk even further than
static pictures do.  Glk Magnetic uses several optimizations to try to reduce
the graphics load on the system, and in particular animates only the portions
of a picture that change between frames.  As a result, pictures with modest
animations work well; pictures with large animated areas may however not
display as effectively.  Fortunately, most of the animated pictures in
Magnetic Windows games don't require large graphics repaints between frames.

The speed and smoothness of animations will probably also depend on the CPU
speed of your system, and on the graphics card, in particular any graphics
acceleration, available.

As with static pictures, Glk Magnetic interleaves animation frames with game
play using a background "thread", if necessary breaking individual animation
frames into pieces so that that game play is not interrupted for too long.

You can use the "-nx" option to turn off picture animation.  Glk Magnetic will
then display just the static portions of a game's pictures.


Gamma Colour Corrections
------------------------

Some of the Magnetic Scrolls pictures look fine without gamma corrections.  On
the other hand, others, in particular those in "Corruption", and several from
"Wonderland", can look very dark if not corrected.

To try to adjust for this, Glk Magnetic will apply an automatic gamma
correction to each picture.  It selects a suitable gamma based on analyzing the
colours that the picture uses, and choosing one that gives reasonable colour
contrast.

There are two levels of automatic gamma correction: 'normal' and 'high'.  In
normal mode, the gamma correction is half of that needed to completely even
out the contrast between picture colours, offering a reasonable balance between
the amount of picture brightening and garish or faded colours.  In high mode,
the gamma correction is that needed to fully even out the contrast between
picture colours.  Use "glk gamma" when in a game to switch between these modes,
or to turn gamma correction off altogether.

You can use the "-ng" option to turn off gamma colour corrections.  In this
case, all pictures are displayed using their original colour palette.


Game Hints
----------

Where a game comes with hints (Wonderland, and the "collection" games), Glk
Magnetic will try to display them if possible.

For Glk libraries that support separate windows, Glk Magnetic shows hints in a
pair of windows which overlay the main game text window.  The upper hint
window gives a menu of hint topics.  The lower one shows the game hints one at
a time.

For Glk libraries that don't support separate windows, Glk Magnetic shows hints
in the main game window, using the best formatting it can arrange.

Glk Magnetic will not show hints if there is no suitable ".HNT" or ".hnt" hints
file, or if the interpreter cannot open the hints file successfully.


Status Line
-----------

Magnetic Scrolls games print a status line, and Glk Magnetic will display this
in a separate window above the main window, for Glk libraries that support
separate windows.

For other Glk libraries, Glk Magnetic will print the status line in "[...]"
brackets above the standard game output following each turn, but only when the
status line has changed since the last turn.

Note that Magnetic Windows games generally do not print a status line.  For
these games, Glk Magnetic will instead try to identify the game's title, and
display it, if identifiable, on the status line.


Expanding Abbreviations
-----------------------

Many IF games systems allow a player to use single character abbreviations for
selected common commands, for example, 'x' for 'examine', 'l' for look, and so
on.  Not all Magnetic Scrolls games offer this feature, however.

To try to help the player, Glk Magnetic will automatically expand a selection
of single character commands, before passing the expanded string to the game
as input.  It expands a command only if the first word of the command is a
single letter, and one of the following:

	'c' -> "close"		'g' -> "again"		'i' -> "inventory"
	'k' -> "attack"		'l' -> "look"		'p' -> "open"
	'q' -> "quit"		'r' -> "drop"		't' -> "take"
	'x' -> "examine" 	'y' -> "yes"		'z' -> "wait"

If you want to suppress abbreviation expansion, you can prefix your input with
a single quote character (like putting literal strings into a spreadsheet).
If you do this, the Glk interface will strip the quote, then pass the rest of
the string to the main interpreter without any more changes.  So for example,

	'x something

will pass the string "x something" back to the game, whereas

	x something

will pass "examine something" back to the game.

You can turn off abbreviation expansions with the command line option '-na'.


Interpreting Commands Locally
-----------------------------

Glk Magnetic will handle special commands if they are prefixed with the string
'glk'.  It understands the following special commands:

	help		  Prints help on Glk special commands
	summary		  Prints all current Glk settings
	version		  Prints the Glk library and Glk port version numbers
	license		  Prints the Glk port license

	undo		  Undoes the prior game move
	script on	  Starts recording the game text output sent to the
			  main game window
	script off	  Turns off game text recording
	inputlog on	  Starts recording input lines typed by the player
	inputlog off	  Stops recording input lines
	readlog on	  Reads an input log file as if it had been typed by
			  a player; reading stops automatically at the end of
			  the file
	abbreviations on  Turn abbreviation expansion on
	abbreviations off Turn abbreviation expansion off
	graphics on	  Turn on Glk graphics
	graphics off	  Turn off Glk graphics (see below)
	gamma normal	  Set automatic gamma colour correction mode to normal
	gamma high	  Set automatic gamma colour correction mode to high
	gamma off	  Turn automatic gamma colour correction off
	animations off	  Turn picture animation off
	animations on	  Turn picture animation on
	prompts on	  Turn extra "> " prompting on
	prompts off	  Turn extra "> " prompting off
	commands off	  Turn of Glk special commands; once off, there is no
			  way to turn them back on

You can abbreviate these commands, as long as the abbreviation you use is
unambiguous.  To improve compatibility with other IF games systems, Glk
Magnetic also recognizes the single word command "undo" as being equivalent
to "glk undo".

If for some reason you need to pass the string "glk" to the interpreter, you
can, as with abbreviations above, prefix it with a single quote character.

You can turn off local command handling with the command line option '-nc'.

If both abbreviation expansion and local command handling are turned off, there
is no need to use single quotes to suppress special interpreter features.


A Few Last Words on Graphics
----------------------------

When turning graphics on and off with Glk commands, you should pay special
attention to whether graphics are turned on or off in the game.  In order for
graphics to be displayed, they must be turned on both in the game AND in Glk.
Turning off graphics in Glk is a little more permanent than turning them off
in a game.  In some games, turning graphics off seems to mean do not display
new pictures, but leave the current picture on the display; turning off
graphics in Glk closes the graphics display window completely.

What can also be confusing is the tendency of Magnetic Windows games to display
a picture automatically only on your first visit to a game location, unless in
'verbose' mode.  On subsequent visits, a "look" command is needed to redisplay
the picture.  This appears not to happen with Magnetic Scrolls games.

Why an additional Glk way to turn off pictures?  Well, the Magnetic Windows and
Magnetic Scrolls games don't always behave the same way with the "graphics"
command, so a control inside Glk Magnetic itself gives a more consistent way
to turn graphics on and off.  The command

	glk graphics

with no on/off argument, prints out a brief information about the current state
of a game's graphics.  In practice, it's probably best to stick to just one
method of turning graphics on and off -- either the game's own way, or the
'glk graphics' command.

GLK Port
--------

Thanks to David Kinder for hints and tips on how to go about the port, and of
course to Niclas Karlsson and his collaborators for the underlying Magnetic
Scrolls interpreter, which looks like it probably wasn't a lot of fun to work
on at times.

Thanks also to Ben Hines <bhines@alumni.ucsd.edu> for the Mac code.  I've
copied in from AGiliTy with, I think, the appropriate modifications, but it's
untested at present.

<h3>SCOTT 1.14</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cspiegel/scottfree-glk">Website</a>
</p>
<button class="accordion">Readme</button>
<div class="panel">
<pre>
This is my second serious production edition of the Scott Adams game
player. It needs curses (or an equivalent - eg pccurses. A non-curses
port should be easy too), and an ANSI C compiler.

This code has been tested on a SUN3(SunOS 4.1.1) and on a Pyramid 9820 in
the att universe.


Operation
---------

ScottFree reads and executes TRS80 format Scott Adams datafiles. It is
possible to run other formats either by writing a loader for that format or
a convertor to TRS80 format. Remember the Scott Adams games are still
copyright - you need to buy or obtain the games legally for use with this
interpreter. Some Scott Adams material is available fairly freely . Dec 1980
Byte contains a game driver and also a program to write a version of Pirate
Adventure. A PC-SIG disk contains Adventureland in BASIC with a database in
DATA statements. The file 'Definition' in this archive explains the TRS80
format as I believe it exists. Much of this definition comes from P.D.Doherty
who provided a lot of information.

ScottFree should run all the Scott Adams, Brian Howarth and some other
Adventure International games. (Gremlins and Supergran have a compressed
action table,  Robin Of Sherwood and Seas Of Blood have both a compressed
action table and compressed text.  Seas Of Blood won't run straight off due
to the bizarre Fighting Fantasy (tm) combat system built into it.)

Command Options
---------------

ScottFree [flags] <databasename> [save-file]

Specifying save-file causes a restore of the save to take place.

The flags are

-d	Debugging info on load
-i	Generate 'I am' type messages (default)
-y	Generate 'You are', 'You are carrying' type messages for games that
	use these instead (eg Robin Of Sherwood)
-s	Generate authentic Scott Adams driver light messages rather than
	other driver style ones (Light goes out in %d turns..)
-t	Generate TRS80 style display (terminal width is 64 characters; a
	line <-----------------> is displayed after the top stuff; objects
	have periods after them instead of hyphens


Statement Of Copyright/License
------------------------------

This software is supplied subject to the GNU software copyleft (version 2)
available from GNU or for FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu. All material in this
program was developed by Swansea University Computer Society without
disassembly of any other game drivers, only of game databases as permitted
by EEC law (for purposes of compatibility). It is your responsibility not
to transfer this software to any country where such reverse engineering is
not permitted. This software license does not include any rights with
regards to the Scott Adams games themselves. These games are copyright and
you should obtain them from a legal source.

The following information sources were used to produce the game driver:

PC-SIG disk of Adventureland:
	This gives the Adventureland database as well as about 80% of the
full interpreter system. The core of the gamedriver was written using this
as a reference to the game code.

Byte Dec 1980:
	This contains a good article about Scott and his games, as well as
a TRS80 driver and datafile writer for the 'Pirate Adventure' game. This
filled in some more answers as well as bits of the TRS80 data format

P.D.Doherty:
	Many thanks go to him for figuring out a load more actions, testing,
hunting for games which used unknown actions and for writing a Scott Adams
database to readable text convertor. This helped resolve several other
actions.


Changes 1.14
------------

o	Bit flag 16 support
o	Lamp behaviour flag '-p' for prehistoric databases which don't use
	bit 16
o	Light out messages don't appear when the lamp is elsewhere.
o	Automatic get/drop has synonym support.

Changes 1.13
------------

o	Darkness is now done like the actual Scott driver seems to do it,
	using bit flag 15. Fixes problems in The Count
o	Display problem with 4.4BSD curses fixed (added a wmove() call)
o	Can't TAKE ALL in a dark room.

Changes 1.12a
-------------

o	Merged in some fixes by Steve Rice <sarice@edaca.ingr.com>
	(Variables for terminal size, wrong wraparound due to bug in Look(),
	TRS80 style option)
o	Updated PC version.

Changes 1.12
------------

o	Merged in some fixes by Antoine Sabot-Durand <sabot@fr.dgac.stna7>
	(Redraw in dark rooms, darkness flag testing, Action 74 bug).
	'Pirate Adventure' should now work.
o	Added some comments
o	Added a makefile
o	Fixed several missing redraws.

Changes 1.11
------------

o	Major bug in file reading routines fixed. This should now read
	_ALL_ the Scott Adams files without you having to add spaces.
o	Knows about the use of // in item texts and correctly handles it.
o	Uses unsigned char for the location of an item so that it correctly
	behaves like the spectrum editions on wrapping. This makes a lot
	more of the Brian Howarth material work.
o	Rewrote the awful OutBuf() function to be a bit neater.
o	Messed up the neat OutBuf() function by supporting old BSD curses
	too. Linux people and 386BSD people should now be in luck, as
	should any old BSD4.x users.
o	TAKE ALL/DROP ALL. Emulates Brian Howarth driver including the
	number of moves bug.
	NOTE:: TAKE ALL/DROP ALL count as one move. In some games that
	give limited moves for things this makes it easier or enables
	you to do things you should not be able to. The Brian Howarth
	games all have this feature and should be fine.
o	Started work on an Xview version - don't expect it just yet.
o	Fixed a major cockup in the execution rules for lines. Robin Of
	Sherwood lets you out of the cell without killing you at last.
o	Place item -> location failed with some compilers (most), now
	made portable.
o	WAIT action refreshes display first
o	Redraws any pending display changes before the status table
o	Option flags tidied up.

Changes 1.10
------------

o	Action 75 added (dunno how it was missed)
o	Corrected second Byte year reference

Changes 1.9
-----------

o	Inventory short cut
o	Swap room flag/location now fixed. This should make Claymorgue work
	correctly (ha!).
o	Corrected Byte reference from 1990 to 1980.

Changes 1.8
-----------

o	Move location action sets the redraw flag
o	Driver ignored last line of table (now fixed)
o	Save/Load implemented.
o	N,E,S,W,U,D shortcuts added. I will add the item ones once I've
	loaded a few more fake saves into the genuine Brian Howarth driver
	to figure out how it works.

To Do
-----

o	Tidy up TAKE ALL/DROP ALL. They match the Spectrum version -
	which appears to be buggy. Also note that using GET ALL / DROP ALL
	with older games _MAY_BREAK_THINGS_. Maybe this should be a flagged
	option.

<button class="accordion">GNU GPL 2.0</button>
<div class="panel">
<pre>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The
intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the
development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as
open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms
of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the
Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different
licensing arrangement.

Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
the copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material
to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
modify the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given
Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified
Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to
others outside of your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does
not mean licensing fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or
has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright
Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
modified by The Copyright Holder in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
configuration files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled byte code, object code, binary, or
any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of
the Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you
do not Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either
gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the
original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion,
such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the
Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be
subject to the Original License.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from
the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-
standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at
least ONE of the following:

(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.

(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified
Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard
Version.

(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
Source form of the Modified Version available to others under

  (i) the Original License or

  (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply
to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of
the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
without the Source

(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get
the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the
time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are
carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid
instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become
aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your
rights under this license.

(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
Source of the Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package

(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as
included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
stand-alone binary or byte code versions of applications that include the
Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result
does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely
extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the
Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of
this license.

General Provisions

(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or
distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or
distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.

(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure
that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service
mark, trade name, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-
charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are
necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent
litigation (including a cross-claim or counter-claim) against any
party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall
terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.

(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND
WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE
DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER
OR CONTRIBUTORWILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
