In this directory the backwards compatibilty of the compiler is tested
by running old interpeters on its output.

pre3.0beta should all load and run the games. New .a3c-files are
generated by the new compiler and run by the stored older compilers
for Windows and MacOSX.

3.0beta3 broke backwards compatibility because of attributes to
literals. So version prior to this is not included here. Look in
../compiler-non-literal-attribute for that.
